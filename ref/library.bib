   abstract = {Oral homeostasis is dependent upon saliva and its content of proteins. Reflex salivary flow occurs at a low 'resting' rate and for short periods of the day more intense taste or chewing stimuli evoke up to ten fold increases in salivation. The secretion of salivary fluid and proteins is controlled by autonomic nerves. All salivary glands are supplied by cholinergic parasympathetic nerves which release acetylcholine that binds to M3 and (to a lesser extent) M1 muscarinic receptors, evoking the secretion of saliva by acinar cells in the endpieces of the salivary gland ductal tree. Most salivary glands also receive a variable innervation from sympathetic nerves which released noradrenaline from which tends to evoke greater release of stored proteins, mostly from acinar cells but also ductal cells. There is some 'cross-talk' between the calcium and cyclic AMP intracellular pathways coupling autonomic stimulation to secretion and salivary protein secretion is augmented during combined stimulation. Other non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic neuropeptides released from autonomic nerves evoke salivary gland secretion and parasympathetically derived vasointestinal peptide, acting through endothelial cell derived nitric oxide, plays a role in the reflex vasodilatation that accompanies secretion. Neuronal type, calcium-activated, soluble nitric oxide within salivary cells appears to play a role in mediating salivary protein secretion in response to autonomimetics. Fluid secretion by salivary glands involves aquaporin 5 and the extent to which the expression of aquaporin 5 on apical acinar cell membranes is upregulated by cholinomimetics remains uncertain. Extended periods of autonomic denervation, liquid diet feeding (reduced reflex stimulation) or duct ligation cause salivary gland atrophy. The latter two are reversible, demonstrating that glands can regenerate provided that the autonomic innervation remains intact. The mechanisms by which nerves integrate with salivary cells during regeneration or during salivary gland development remain to be elucidated. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The rat liver is immature at birth but by PND 21, all hepatic cords are one-cell layer thick and bile ductules are formed. Extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH) is very prominent until PND 10, and thereafter diminishes dramatically by PND 28. At birth, the pancreas contains acini bloated with pancreatic enzymes, which become depleted rapidly in the first 2–3 days with the onset of suckling, and the pancreas is histologically mature by PND 28. Of the three major salivary glands, the sublingual salivary gland is the most developed at birth, followed by the submandibular, whereas the parotid gland is the least developed. These glands are morphologically mature by PND 28. The submandibular gland has unique convoluted granular ducts that appear microscopically different in adult males and females, but this sexual dimorphism is barely discernible by PND 42.},

   abstract = {Several functions are acknowledged for saliva secretion in different animal species follow-ing prehension and mastication of feed. Most of such are linked to the specific role of lubrication and softening of the bolus to allow taste perception and easy swallowing. Moreover, enzymatic components are produced in the saliva, some of which are destined to contribute to the digestion of different nutrients (to various extents according to animal species) and to exert antimicrobial activity (lysozyme). In addition, the buffering power and the virtuous recycle of water, electrolytes, and other metabolites are of particular importance for proper digestion and for nutrition–related aspects. Moreover, salivation appears to be involved in a number of other functions. Recent studies on salivary production and roles point to salivary glands as target organs of neuroendocrine regulation in response to many external stimuli coming from the outer world, for which feed still represents the chief external stimulus. Various animal species establish an adaptive strategy when coming into contact with different feeding stuffs and/or dietary substances by modifying both the composition and amount of saliva produced. In the light of recent updates, this review provides a focus on the functional roles of saliva secretions, showing the broad involvement of salivary response in several mechanisms beyond the digestive function and influencing feed selection.},

As an additional objective, serum cortisol concentrations of saliva samples obtained with or without citric acid and with or without previous pH adjustment were compared. Five clinically healthy were randomly assigned to one of 5 treatments with cottons with different substances: 1) control, 2) citric acid, 3) acetic acid, 4) sodium chloride, 5) sucrose. Each dog received one treatment per day, and in 5 days, all dogs were tested with the five treatments. On each day, cottons were applied to dogs at times 0, 20, 40, 60 and 80 minutes. The cottons with citric acid generated more volume than the rest of the treatments (p<0.0001), and sodium chloride generated more volume than the control and acetic acid (p≤0.03). Cottons with citric acid generated lower pH of saliva than the rest of the treatments (p<0.0001). Cottons with acetic acid generated lower pH than control, sodium chloride and sucrose (p<0.0001). There were no differences in cortisol concentrations between the control samples and those obtained with citric acid, nor between these same samples with and without pH adjusted with buffer. The concentration of proteins in saliva and excitement degree did not change with treatment. Citric acid was more palatable than the rest of the treatments (p<0.0001). Sodium chloride and sucrose were more palatable than control (p<0.05). In conclusion, citric acid was the chemical stimulant that generated greater volume of saliva and greater palatability in dogs. Although the pH of the saliva obtained with citric acid was clearly acidic, its acidic pH did not affect the determination of cortisol by chemiluminescence or RIA. Sodium chloride and sucrose allowed to obtain high volumes of saliva and were more palatable than the control, which can be other interesting options to obtain saliva in case of not being able to use citric acid.},

It has been extensively characterized in humans but its protein composition in dogs remains poorly characterized, yet saliva composition could explain (patho) physiological differences between individuals, breeds and with humans. This pilot discovery study aimed to characterize canine saliva from two breeds, Labrador retrievers and Beagles, and to compare this with human saliva using quantitative mass spectrometry. The analysis demonstrated considerable inter-individual variation and difference between breeds; however these were small in comparison to the differences between species. Functional mapping suggested roles of detected proteins similar to those found in human saliva with the exception of the initiation of digestion as salivary amylase was lacking or at very low abundance in canine saliva samples. Many potential anti-microbial proteins were detected agreeing with the notion that the oral cavity is under continuous microbial challenge.},

   abstract = {Background: Salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) is considered a biomarker of sympathetic activation in humans, but there is controversy regarding the existence of sAA in dogs. The hypothesis of this study was that sAA exists in dogs and it could change in situations of sympathetic stimulation. Therefore, the aims of this study were: 1) to demonstrate the presence of alpha-amylase in saliva of dogs by Western-Blot, 2) to validate an spectrophotometric method for the measurement of sAA activity and 3) to evaluate the possible changes in sAA activity after the induction of an ejaculation in dogs which is known to produce a sympathetic activation. Results: Western-Blot demonstrated a band in dog saliva specimens between 60kDa and 50kDa, similar to purified sAA. The spectrophotometric assay validated showed an adequate inter- and intra-assay precision, and a high correlation coefficient (r=0.999) in the linearity under dilution study. sAA median activity significantly increased just after ejaculation compared with just before the ejaculation (2.06-fold, P=0.005). Conclusions: This study demonstrated the existence of alpha-amylase in saliva of dogs and that this enzyme can be measured by a spectrophotometric assay. In addition, results showed that sAA increase after a sympathetic activation and could be potentially used as non-invasive biomarker of sympathetic activity in this species.},

During the recovery from the anesthesia, the presence of bilateral dense submandibular masses was recognized, as was the excessive secretion of saliva. An ultrasound examination was performed and revealed bilateral abnormally-diffused enlargement of the submandibular salivary glands. A cytology examination was conducted, and no signs of abnormality were found. The size of the swellings subsequently diminished, completely subsiding after 2 hr, as did the hyper-salivation.

   abstract = {Objectives: The pathogenesis of acinar enlargement in sialadenosis is obscure. As myoepithelial cells had been reported to show degenerative changes, we decided to investigate the possible role of functionally deficient myoepithelial cells in the development of sialadenosis. Study design: This study was a morphometric analysis of glands immunohistochemically stained for CK14, α-actin, and Ki67 in 10 cases of sialadenosis and 11 normal parotids. Results: In sialadenosis, acini were much larger; there was a minor decrease in the density of the distribution of myoepithelial cells stained for CK14 and a major decrease in the density of the distribution and thickness of the myofilament component of myoepithelial cells stained for α-actin; and the proliferation of acinar and myoepithelial cells was reduced. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate a major loss and thinning of the myofilament component of the myoepithelial cells and thereby a loss of mechanical support for the acini in sialadenosis. This possibly allows acinar cells to expand as secretory granules accumulate intracellularly to produce the great acinar enlargement. This functional myoepithelial insufficiency is possibly a consequence of an autonomic neuropathy secondary to severe metabolic or hormonal disorders. © 2010 Mosby, Inc.},

   abstract = {Epilepsy is a common neurological disease in both humans and domestic dogs, making dogs an ideal translational model of epilepsy. In both species, epilepsy is a complex brain disease characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate spontaneous recurrent epileptic seizures. Furthermore, as in humans, status epilepticus is one of the more common neurological emergencies in dogs with epilepsy. In both species, epilepsy is not a single disease but a group of disorders characterized by a broad array of clinical signs, age of onset, and underlying causes. Brain imaging suggests that the limbic system, including the hippocampus and cingulate gyrus, is often affected in canine epilepsy, which could explain the high incidence of comorbid behavioral problems such as anxiety and cognitive alterations. Resistance to antiseizure medications is a significant problem in both canine and human epilepsy, so dogs can be used to study mechanisms of drug resistance and develop novel therapeutic strategies to benefit both species. Importantly, dogs are large enough to accommodate intracranial EEG and responsive neurostimulation devices designed for humans. Studies in epileptic dogs with such devices have reported ictal and interictal events that are remarkably similar to those occurring in human epilepsy. Continuous (24/7) EEG recordings in a select group of epileptic dogs for >1 year have provided a rich dataset of unprecedented length for studying seizure periodicities and developing new methods for seizure forecasting. The data presented in this review substantiate that canine epilepsy is an excellent translational model for several facets of epilepsy research. Furthermore, several techniques of inducing seizures in laboratory dogs are discussed as related to therapeutic advances. Importantly, the development of vagus nerve stimulation as a novel therapy for drug-resistant epilepsy in people was based on a series of studies in dogs with induced seizures. Dogs with naturally occurring or induced seizures provide excellent large-animal models to bridge the translational gap between rodents and humans in the development of novel therapies. Furthermore, because the dog is not only a preclinical species for human medicine but also a potential patient and pet, research on this species serves both veterinary and human medicine.},

   abstract = {The lack of therapeutics that prevent the development of epilepsy, improve disease prognosis or overcome drug resistance represents an unmet clinical need in veterinary as well as in human medicine. Over the past decade, experimental studies and studies in human epilepsy patients have demonstrated that neuroinflammatory processes are involved in epilepsy development and play a key role in neuronal hyperexcitability that underlies seizure generation. Targeting neuroinflammatory signaling pathways may provide a basis for clinically relevant disease-modification strategies in general, and moreover, could open up new therapeutic avenues for human and veterinary patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. A sound understanding of the neuroinflammatory mechanisms underlying seizure pathogenesis in canine patients is therefore essential for mechanism-based discovery of selective epilepsy therapies that may enable the development of new disease-modifying treatments. In particular, subgroups of canine patients in urgent needs, e.g. dogs with drug-resistant epilepsy, might benefit from more intensive research in this area. Moreover, canine epilepsy shares remarkable similarities in etiology, disease manifestation, and disease progression with human epilepsy. Thus, canine epilepsy is discussed as a translational model for the human disease and epileptic dogs could provide a complementary species for the evaluation of antiepileptic and antiseizure drugs. This review reports key preclinical and clinical findings from experimental research and human medicine supporting the role of neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of epilepsy. Moreover, the article provides an overview of the current state of knowledge regarding neuroinflammatory processes in canine epilepsy emphasizing the urgent need for further research in this specific field. It also highlights possible functional impact, translational potential and future perspectives of targeting specific inflammatory pathways as disease-modifying and multi-target treatment options for canine epilepsy.},

Owners of dogs with epilepsy have previously indicated that their dog's quality of life (QoL) is of greatest importance to them above seizure frequency; however, much of the research into canine epilepsy to date has focussed on seizure frequency, and how to reduce it via antiepileptic drug treatment. In people, the impact of epilepsy upon QoL has been widely studied, exploring not only its impact on physical health, but also the psychological health and cognitive capabilities of affected individuals. This paper reviews the existing literature on canine epilepsy, identifies potential threats to QoL, and draws parallels from human epilepsy research. We suggest that canine epilepsy poses threats to both quality and quantity of life, with treatment interventions posing a fine balance of potential benefits and harms to the patient. At present, little is known about the neurobehavioural, emotional and cognitive effects of epilepsy upon affected dogs. Further studies are needed to establish the extent to which unknown QoL-inhibiting comorbidities exist in the dog, in order to avoid their undertreatment, and to objectively quantify the effects of epilepsy on canine QoL.},

Despite idiopathic epilepsy being one of the most common neurological conditions in dogs, our understanding of it in veterinary medicine lags that in human medicine. The relative underuse of EEG in dogs with seizures has potential causes including practical issues, financial concerns, lack of training/equipment, and questions of clinical value. This technological underuse may lead to, or result from, major gaps in our understanding of EEG in veterinary patients. This underutilization of EEG is of significant clinical relevance because the diagnosis of specific epilepsy syndromes in humans guides the treatment, namely pharmacological, dietary, or surgical. These epilepsy syndromes are diagnosed based on several factors, one of which is the characteristic electrical brain activity on EEG. The aim of this narrative literature review was to highlight the study of cortical brain activity to improve our understanding of EEG in veterinary medicine. Specifically, the utility of EEG with focus on the existing proposed electrode arrays and their current supporting evidence. A recent survey study confirmed that a variety of canine EEG protocols are concurrently in use, including diverse electrode arrays. By comparison, in humans there is a standardized 10–20 electrode array, with average localization error of 13–17 mm depending on the number of placed electrodes on the scalp. We offer a review of the factors that would contribute to the ideal canine EEG electrode array highlighting areas for improvement and future validation. This proposed level of understanding will facilitate the identification of cortical seizure foci with a known degree of error, paving the way for non-pharmaceutical interventions like epilepsy surgeries.},

The dog had both mandibular salivary gland enlargement but was cytologically normal. Hematology blood chemistry and urinalysis were unremarkable except for neutrophilic leukocytosis and hypokalemia. Contrast study radiography found gas in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and contrast medium left in the esophagus while abdominal ultrasonography was unremarkable. Oropharyngeal and upper GI endoscopy confirmed cervical esophageal dilatation. The dog did not respond to symptomatic treatment. Sialadenosis was diagnosed based on the clinical signs and the ruling out of other diseases with a similar presentation. Medical treatment with phenobarbital was initiated at a dosage of 1.5 mg/kg orally twice daily for 3 months. The clinical signs diminished in a few days and were completely absent within 2 weeks. The mandibular salivary glands were smaller and softened after 2 weeks of treatment. After 3 months, phenobarbital dosage was tapered (reduced) every month and withdrawn at 6 months. Seven months after treatment, the mandibular salivary gland could not be palpated and the dog gained weight and had no clinical signs. This is the first case of phenobarbital-responsive sialadenosis reported in Thailand.},

   abstract = {Sialadenosis is a bilateral, painless, noninflammatory, uniform, and nonneoplastic condition reported in human and animal medicine. It is a rare condition in animal medicine with only a handful of case reports published to date. According to the different case reviews in the veterinary literature, it can be classified under different forms that are associated with enlargement of a salivary gland with gastrointestinal diseases or without any other abnormality and also phenobarbital responsive or non-responsive form. Phenobarbital-responsive sialadenosis associated with an oesophagal foreign body has also been reported in a dog. This communication presents a case report of phenobarbital responsive sialadenosis of a ten-month old male Rottweiler. This dog was presented with the main complaint of acute vomiting together with inappetence, gulping, and progressive weight loss. Imaging studies revealed gastrointestinal inflammation in the stomach with mild ulceration with unclear aetiology. The dog did not show any improvement to symptomatic treatments. Additionally, it developed bilateral enlargement of the submandibular salivary glands which were hard in consistency and evident at the second presentation at 10 days after the first. Treatment with oral phenobarbital brought rapid resolution of clinical signs. Until recently, the pathogenesis of sialadenosis and why it does respond to phenobarbital have not been well understood. Because of the response to phenobarbital treatments, sialadenosis may represent a form of limbic epilepsy or peripheral autonomic dysfunction.},

Such autonomic symptoms may impact cardiorespiratory function.

   abstract = {Background: Cytopenias have been reported in dogs treated with phenobarbital, but detailed descriptions of bone marrow findings and response to treatment are lacking. Objectives: We aimed to characterize the hematologic findings and clinical outcomes of dogs that had been receiving phenobarbital at the time of marrow evaluation. Methods: Archived bone marrow slides and clinicopathologic data were reviewed in dogs undergoing marrow evaluation for any hematologic problems that developed while receiving phenobarbital (2008-2020). Dogs were excluded if marrow samples lacked diagnostic value, phenobarbital was withdrawn >1 day before marrow collection, a same-day complete blood count (CBC) was lacking, or dogs had concurrent illness or therapy known to cause cytopenias. Results: Thirteen dogs met inclusion criteria: eight pancytopenic, three anemic/thrombocytopenic, one neutropenic/thrombocytopenic, and one nearly neutropenic. Neutropenia was marked (<700/µL) in eight dogs; all neutrophil concentrations were low or low-normal. Of the 11 anemic dogs (Hct = 12%-42%, median = 29%), three had mild reticulocytosis (eight were tested). One dog had erythroid dysplasia in blood and marrow. All nine neutropenic dogs had evidence of ineffective neutropoiesis: neutrophilic hyperplasia with left shift (9) ± neutrophagocytosis (5). Eight of the 11 anemic dogs had evidence of ineffective erythropoiesis: erythroid hyperplasia (7), left shift (3), and/or rubriphagocytosis (6). No thrombocytopenic dog had megakaryocytic hypoplasia; seven dogs had megakaryocytic hyperplasia. One anemic/thrombocytopenic dog had marked collagen myelofibrosis. The noncytopenic dog had equivocal myeloid hypoplasia with neutrophagocytosis. Median maximal responses and resolution times for neutropenia (n = 6) were 14 days. Conclusions: Phenobarbital-induced cytopenias should be considered in dogs with multilineage ineffective hematopoiesis, particularly when neutropenia and myeloid hyperplasia are present. However, findings in dogs with immune-mediated neutropenia or precursor-targeted immune-mediated anemia might be indistinguishable.},

   abstract = {A ten-year-old indoor, castrated male Cardigan Welsh Corgi (Canis familiaris) presented with the chief complaints of chronic vomiting, retching, hypersalivation, and bilateral submandibular masses for two months. The systemic examinations, including serum chemistry, radiography, ultrasonography, and fluoroscopy, were unremarkable. A fine-needle aspiration revealed bilateral submandibular sialadenitis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics with phenobarbital were prescribed to alleviate the ptyalism. Thereafter, the left submandibular glands were normalised, and the right submandibular glands decreased to half their size. Three weeks later, the animal had an emergency visit because of a sudden left exophthalmos. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed enlarged left zygomatic and right mandibular salivary glands. The affected glands were surgically removed; the histopathologic examination confirmed non-septic sialadenitis, and the patient was finally diagnosed with idiopathic sialadenitis. Vomiting continued after the gland removal and the dog required a gradual increase in the phenobarbital dosage and an additional antiepileptic drug (potassium bromide) to manage the symptoms. The patient died eight months later from an unknown cause. This case report of bilateral submandibular sialadenitis concurrent with unilateral zygomatic sialadenitis in a Welsh Corgi dog suggests that when multiple salivary glands are involved, the response to anti-epileptic drugs and the prognosis is poor compared to that involving a single salivary gland.},

A retrospective analysis was performed on the medical records of 233 dogs and information pertaining to 65 dogs was collected as part of a prospective study. All the animals were client-owned. Patients from the retrospective study underwent thoracic radiography or oesophageal endoscopy to diagnose and characterise the infection and were placed on therapy with a macrocyclic lactone, whereas the patients in the prospective study had both radiography and endoscopy routinely performed and biopsies of the oesophageal nodules collected where possible. Tru-cut biopsies of affected salivary glands were taken in 10 of 13 patients demonstrating clinical signs of sialorrhoea and salivary gland enlargement. The entire salivary gland was sectioned in an additional three dogs with spirocercosis and no sialorrhoea that were presented for post mortem examination. Sialorrhoea was present in 33/298 cases (11%). Fox terrier breeds were over-represented in the patients with sialorrhoea, comprising 36% of cases, whereas they only comprised 1.5% of the patients without sialorrhoea (p < 0.001, chi squared test) and 5% of the combined group. Dogs weighing 12 kg or less were significantly over-represented in the sialorrhoea group, 69% versus 19.5% (p < 0.001, chi square test). Age was not significantly different between the two groups (p < 0.08, Mann-Whitney test). The number of oesophageal nodules per case was significantly higher in the non-sialorrhoea cases (p = 0.048, Mann-Whitney test). The prevalence of distal oesophageal and lower oesophageal sphincter involvement, and neoplastic transformation of the nodules were not statistically different between the two groups. None of the fox terriers in either group showed neoplastic transformation of the parasitic nodules even though they were over-represented as a breed. Mandibular salivary glands were affected in 86% of cases showing sialorrhoea. Histopathology revealed acinar hyperplasia in all cases with concurrent necrosis detected in only two cases. Sialorrhoea and salivary gland enlargement has an incidence of 11% (33/298 cases) in canine spirocercosis. Small breeds (≤ 12 kg) and particularly fox terrier breeds are over-represented in the group demonstrating sialorrhoea and this appeared to be the only risk factor. The conclusion was that sialorrhoea secondary to canine spirocercosis occurs frequently and its presence should prompt further investigation for oesophageal and gastro-intestinal disease. Severely affected patients can be managed with phenobarbitone to control the dysphagia in addition to the routine macrocyclic lactones treatment. © 2012. The Authors.},

Study design: Retrospective multicenter study. Animals: Dogs (140) with mandibular and sublingual sialocele. Methods: Medical records of dogs that underwent mandibular and sublingual sialoadenectomy through a LAT or VPM approach from 2004 to 2020 were reviewed. Clinical and histopathological findings were analyzed to compare the groups. Results: Seventy dogs were included in each group. The most represented breed was crossbreed (26%), and males (99/140 [71%], intact/neutered) were overrepresented. Dogs in the VPM approach group were more likely to undergo digastricus tunnelization and placement of a drain or a bandage. Dogs in the LAT approach group were heavier and more likely to undergo excision of an inflammatory pseudocapsule. No difference was detected in complication rates between groups (LAT [20%], VPM [31%], P =.116). Recurrences were more likely after LAT approach (5/70 vs 0/70, respectively; P =.029), whereas wound-related complications were more likely after VPM approach (20/70 vs 9/70, respectively; P =.018). Prolonged duration of surgery was associated with an increased risk of recurrence, and none of the other variables affected the complication rate. Conclusion: Ventral paramedian approach for mandibular and sublingual sialoadenectomy was associated with a lower risk of recurrence but a higher risk of wound-related complications compared with LAT approach. Clinical significance: Ventral paramedian approach for mandibular and sublingual sialoadenectomy may be preferred to reduce recurrence in dogs with sialoceles, but wound-related complications are common.},

This retrospective matched case–control study investigated the association between hypercortisolism, long-term glucocorticoid treatment, and sialocele in dogs. We retrospectively reviewed the records from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2022. Records of 19 dogs diagnosed with sialocele were investigated for hypercortisolism and long-term glucocorticoid treatment. Two age- and breed-matched controls for each sialocele dog (38 dogs) were investigated for the same concurrent diseases. Logistic regression analysis was used. The odds of sialocele in dogs with hypercortisolism were 15.56 times those of dogs without hypercortisolism (p = 0.02; 95% CI: 1.54–156.79). The odds of sialocele in dogs with long-term glucocorticoid treatment (median, 8 months; range, 5–13) were 7.78 times those of dogs without long-term glucocorticoid treatment (p = 0.03; 95% CI: 1.23–49.40). No associations were found between age, sex, body weight, and the presence of sialocele. The results indicate that sialocele was significantly associated with hypercortisolism and long-term glucocorticoid treatment in dogs. Therefore, dogs with hypercortisolism or receiving long-term glucocorticoid therapy should be screened for possible sialocele. Additionally, dogs with sialocele should be identified for concurrent hypercortisolism and prolonged glucocorticoid exposure.},

Surgery is the recognized first-line treatment. Recurrence rate after surgery is 5–14%. Salivary gland tissue is very sensitive to radiation therapy (RT). Hypothesis/Objectives: Radiation therapy will be useful for the treatment of sialocele.

Methods: Retrospective study of response and outcome after RT. Results: All dogs had cervical sialocele. Seven dogs (63.6%) were treated with 3 weekly fractions of 4 Gray (Gy); (total dose, 12 Gy). Three dogs (27.3%) received 4 fractions of 4 Gy (16 Gy) and 1 dog received 5 fractions of 4 Gy (20 Gy) on a Monday-Wednesday-Friday schedule.

Three dogs had progression of their sialocele 2, 3, and 9 months after RT; all three had received 12 Gy initially and 2 received 2 additional fractions of 4 Gy (cumulative total dose, 20 Gy) and subsequently achieved remission for >2 years. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Radiation therapy is useful for the treatment of recurrent sialocele refractory to surgical management and a minimum total dose of 16 or 20 Gy in 4 Gy fractions appears effective.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE To compare the long-term outcomes of a ventral versus lateral surgical approach for mandibular and sublingual sialoadenectomy in dogs with a unilateral sialocele. ANIMALS 46 client-owned dogs. PROCEDURES Medical records of dogs that underwent unilateral sialoadenectomy between 1999 and 2019 were retrospectively reviewed, and information was collected regarding signalment, clinical signs, historical treatment, swelling location, diagnostic imaging findings, sialoadenectomy approach, adjunctive treatments, intraoperative complications, hospitalization time, postoperative complications, recurrence, and contralateral sialocele development. RESULTS There were no significant differences in incidences of intraoperative complications, recurrence, or postoperative complications between dogs in which a lateral versus ventral approach was used. Clinically important intraoperative complications included iatrogenic tears in the oral mucosa, ligature slippage from the duct end, hemorrhage, and possible lingual nerve transection. Surgical experience was associated with the likelihood that intraoperative complications would develop. Suspected recurrence was reported in 2 of 26 (8%) dogs that underwent a lateral approach and 2 of 12 (17%) dogs that underwent a ventral approach. Hospitalization time was significantly shorter with the lateral approach than with the ventral approach. Postoperative complications had a short-term onset and occurred in 4 of 25 (16%) dogs that underwent a lateral approach and 3 of 12 (25%) dogs that underwent a ventral approach. Age and presence of a pharyngeal sialocele were associated with development of postoperative complications. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Long-term outcomes for ventral and lateral approaches to sialoadenectomy were favorable and appeared to be comparable. Further prospective study into potential associations of sialoadenectomy approach, age, and pharyngeal sialoceles on outcome is needed.},

   abstract = {Background: In general practice it is common to be presented with patients that suffer from salivary gland disease, particularly salivary sialoceles. This disease affects all salivary glands, although most commonly the sublingual salivary gland. There are various treatment approaches that should be considered. The second most common salivary gland disease is salivary gland neoplasia, particularly adenocarcinomas -surgery can be curative when the tumour is confined to the capsule; however, in many cases, these tumours are more invasive and local reoccurrence can occur. Aim of the article: This article discusses the different treatments for salivary sialoceles, paying particular attention to the different approaches for the surgical resection of the mandibular and sublingual salivary gland. It also discusses the surgical treatment methods for parotid and zygomatic sialoceles, as well as salivary gland neoplasia and other less common pathologies.},

Metaplastic ossification of the pseudocapsule is a condition rarely described in the veterinary literature. The main causes of calcification are trauma, tumours, various chronic inflammatory conditions and fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva. The aim of the present case series was to describe three dogs affected by a calcified salivary mucocele. The medical records of dogs affected by a cervical sialocele were retrospectively evaluated, and three cases met the inclusion criteria. All the dogs in this study were referred to the Veterinary Teaching Hospital (VTH) of the Department of Veterinary Sciences of the University of Turin (Turin, Italy) for a large solid mass in the intermandibular region. The diagnosis of a mucocele was confirmed clinically by centesis and by radiography or CT. Complete excision of both the pseudocyst and the ipsilateral mandibular/monostomatic sublingual salivary gland was performed in all cases. The histological report showed large areas of bone metaplasia within the pseudocapsule and chronic sialadenitis. Based on this limited case series, complete excision of the pseudocyst and a concurrent sialoadenectomy provided an effective treatment for this rare salivary mucocele disorder.},

The cause of the mandibular salivary gland enlargement was confirmed as necrotising sialadenitis, while the cause of the zygomatic gland enlargement was presumed to be because of a similar disease process. No underlying aetiology was identified.

   abstract = {A ten-year-old indoor, castrated male Cardigan Welsh Corgi (Canis familiaris) presented with the chief complaints of chronic vomiting, retching, hypersalivation, and bilateral submandibular masses for two months. The systemic examinations, including serum chemistry, radiography, ultrasonography, and fluoroscopy, were unremarkable. A fine-needle aspiration revealed bilateral submandibular sialadenitis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics with phenobarbital were prescribed to alleviate the ptyalism. Thereafter, the left submandibular glands were normalised, and the right submandibular glands decreased to half their size. Three weeks later, the animal had an emergency visit because of a sudden left exophthalmos. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed enlarged left zygomatic and right mandibular salivary glands. The affected glands were surgically removed; the histopathologic examination confirmed non-septic sialadenitis, and the patient was finally diagnosed with idiopathic sialadenitis. Vomiting continued after the gland removal and the dog required a gradual increase in the phenobarbital dosage and an additional antiepileptic drug (potassium bromide) to manage the symptoms. The patient died eight months later from an unknown cause. This case report of bilateral submandibular sialadenitis concurrent with unilateral zygomatic sialadenitis in a Welsh Corgi dog suggests that when multiple salivary glands are involved, the response to anti-epileptic drugs and the prognosis is poor compared to that involving a single salivary gland.},

These signs developed after an exploratory laparotomy and gastrointestinal foreign body removal was performed. On presentation, the ophthalmic examination revealed bilateral decreased retropulsion, absent bilateral direct and consensual pupillary light responses, bilateral blindness, and a superficial ulcer in right eye. Ocular ultrasound and computed tomography of the skull were performed and identified a bilateral retrobulbar mass effect originating from the zygomatic salivary glands. Ultrasound guided fine needle aspirate cytology revealed neutrophilic inflammation. Fungal testing and bacterial cultures were performed which were negative for identification of an infectious organism. The patient was placed on a 5-day course of antibiotic therapy and the response was poor. Phenobarbital was added to the treatment regimen. Two days following phenobarbital administration, the exophthalmos and trismus began to resolve. Following phenobarbital therapy, ocular position normalized, trismus completely resolved, and patient returned to normal behavior although blindness remained in both eyes. No other neurologic condition occurred. This paper highlights the early use of phenobarbital for the rapid resolution of zygomatic sialadenitis.},

Materials and Methods: Clinical databases of three referral institutions were searched for dogs diagnosed with bilateral zygomatic sialadenitis who underwent magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography of the head. Signalment, history, clinical, laboratory and imaging findings were reviewed. Results: Twenty dogs with a mean age (±SD) of 7.1 (±2.7) years were included; Labradors were overrepresented (10/20). Common clinical signs included pain on opening the mouth (18/20), conjunctival hyperaemia (16/20), exophthalmos (15/20), periorbital pain (15/20), third eyelid protrusion (11/20) and resistance to retropulsion of the globes (11/20). Fifteen of twenty dogs had at least one concurrent systemic disease: skin allergy (5/15), hypertension (3/15), gastrointestinal (3/15), kidney (3/15), neurological (3/15) and periodontal disease (2/15), pancreatitis (2/15) and neoplasia (2/15). Neutrophilia (9/18) and leukocytosis (7/18) were the most common haematological abnormalities. When performed (11/20), aspiration cytology revealed predominantly degenerate neutrophils (9/11) and only 2/9 culture samples yielded bacterial growth. The zygomatic glands were predominantly hyperintense on both T1 and T2-weighted images (22/24) and symmetrically enlarged (20/24) with marked and heterogeneous contrast enhancement (18/24). In the computed tomography studies, the zygomatic glands were all hyperattenuating and contrast enhancing. Treatment included systemic antimicrobial (18/20), anti-inflammatory (14/20) and supportive treatment (16/20). Clinical signs improved in 16/20 dogs; however, 4/20 dogs were euthanised due to severe systemic disease. Clinical Significance: Bilateral zygomatic sialadenitis is frequently associated with systemic disease in dogs. Clinical signs generally improve with systemic antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and supportive treatment.},

Methods: A single institution retrospective study was conducted of client-owned dogs with macroscopic SGC treated with SBRT. Patient signalment, clinical characteristics, and treatment parameters were recorded. Clinical benefit was determined based on follow-up physical examination and medical history. Progression-free interval (PFI), median survival time (MST), and disease-specific survival (DSS) were calculated using Kaplan–Meier analysis. Acute and late toxicity were recorded according to Veterinary Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (VRTOG) criteria. Results: Six patients were included in the study. Tumor origins were mandibular (n = 3), parotid (n = 2), and zygomatic (n = 1) salivary glands. The SBRT prescription was 10 Gy × 3 daily or every other day. All patients (100%) experienced clinical benefit from treatment at a median time of 34 days (range 28–214). No local or regional nodal failure was reported following SBRT. Progressive pulmonary metastatic disease was documented in three dogs (50%). The median PFI was 260 days (range 43–1,014) and the MST was 397 days (range 185–1,014). Median DSS was 636 days (range 185–1,014). Four dogs (66.6%) died of confirmed or suspected metastatic SGC. The reported acute side effects included grade 2 mucositis (n = 1) and vision loss (n = 1). No late side effects were recorded. Conclusion: This study suggests that SBRT may provide durable local control for invasive SGC in dogs. Further investigation in a larger cohort of patients is warranted. The incidence of reported acute and late toxicity was low.},

Materials and Methods: Information was collected from cats or dogs with salivary neoplasia (cases) and controls from the 26 university veterinary teaching hospitals within the Veterinary Medical Data Base. A total of 56 dogs and 24 cats were identified as having been diagnosed with salivary neoplasia. Results: The incidence of salivary neoplasia in this population was calculated to be 15.3 per 100,000 dogs and 26.3 per 100,000 cats. The specific anatomic location of the salivary neoplasia was unable to be determined in 90.8% of cases in both dogs and cats. Results of the univariable conditional logistic regression models revealed no increased risk of salivary neoplasia in dogs or cats of any sex or neuter status (dogs: p =.26; cats: p =.45). There was no breed disposition within the feline species for salivary neoplasia. However, in the conditional logistic regression for dogs, poodles (toy and standard) trended towards significance (p =.075) with an odds ratio of 6.83 (95% CI: 1.16–40.10) compared to mixed breeds. Conclusions and clinical relevance: The present study's results differ from previous conclusions made in regards to predisposed breeds and tumour location. Additional epidemiological studies should be performed to help in determining risk factors for salivary gland neoplasia.},

   abstract = {Zygomatic salivary gland disease is not commonly reported in dogs and there is a paucity of literature reporting salivary gland disease secondary to infarction in dogs. A 9-year-old German wirehaired pointer presented with left eye exophthalmos, 3rd eyelid elevation, negative retropulsion, and pain upon opening of the mouth. Computed tomography revealed a mass extending from the left zygomatic salivary gland, consistent with a sialocele. A left-sided zygomatic sialoadenectomy was performed successfully. Histopathologic diagnosis concluded zygomatic salivary gland infarction. The dog had no signs of recurrence 20 mo after surgery. Key clinical message: To the authors' knowledge, this is the first case report with long-term outcome of a zygomatic sialocele secondary to salivary gland infarction in a dog treated by zygomatic sialoadenectomy via zygomatic osteotomy. Résumé-Sialocèle zygomatique secondaire à un infarctus traité par sialoadénectomie chez un chien. Une atteinte des glandes salivaires zygomatiques n'est pas fréquemment rapportée chez le chien et il existe peu de littérature rapportant une maladie des glandes salivaires secondaire à un infarctus chez le chien. Un pointeur allemand à poil dur de 9 ans présentait une exophtalmie de l'oeil gauche, une élévation de la troisième paupière, une rétropulsion négative et une douleur à l'ouverture de la bouche. La tomodensitométrie a révélé une masse s'étendant à partir de la glande salivaire zygomatique gauche, compatible avec une sialocèle. Une sialoadénectomie zygomatique gauche a été réalisée avec succès. Le diagnostic histopathologique a permis de conclure à un infarctus des glandes salivaires zygomatiques. Le chien n'avait aucun signe de récidive 20 mois après la chirurgie. Message clinique clé : À la connaissance des auteurs, il s'agit du premier rapport de cas avec évolution à long terme d'une sialocèle zygomatique secondaire à un infarctus des glandes salivaires chez un chien traité par sialoadénectomie zygomatique via une ostéotomie zygomatique.},

   abstract = {This longitudinal cross-sectional clinical study investigated the incidence of sialorrhoea in dogs with spirocercosis and determined whether breed, body weight and the extent of the oesophageal involvement was associated with this presentation. A retrospective analysis was performed on the medical records of 233 dogs and information pertaining to 65 dogs was collected as part of a prospective study. All the animals were client-owned. Patients from the retrospective study underwent thoracic radiography or oesophageal endoscopy to diagnose and characterise the infection and were placed on therapy with a macrocyclic lactone, whereas the patients in the prospective study had both radiography and endoscopy routinely performed and biopsies of the oesophageal nodules collected where possible. Tru-cut biopsies of affected salivary glands were taken in 10 of 13 patients demonstrating clinical signs of sialorrhoea and salivary gland enlargement. The entire salivary gland was sectioned in an additional three dogs with spirocercosis and no sialorrhoea that were presented for post mortem examination. Sialorrhoea was present in 33/298 cases (11%). Fox terrier breeds were over-represented in the patients with sialorrhoea, comprising 36% of cases, whereas they only comprised 1.5% of the patients without sialorrhoea (p < 0.001, chi squared test) and 5% of the combined group. Dogs weighing 12 kg or less were significantly over-represented in the sialorrhoea group, 69% versus 19.5% (p < 0.001, chi square test). Age was not significantly different between the two groups (p < 0.08, Mann-Whitney test). The number of oesophageal nodules per case was significantly higher in the non-sialorrhoea cases (p = 0.048, Mann-Whitney test). The prevalence of distal oesophageal and lower oesophageal sphincter involvement, and neoplastic transformation of the nodules were not statistically different between the two groups. None of the fox terriers in either group showed neoplastic transformation of the parasitic nodules even though they were over-represented as a breed. Mandibular salivary glands were affected in 86% of cases showing sialorrhoea. Histopathology revealed acinar hyperplasia in all cases with concurrent necrosis detected in only two cases. Sialorrhoea and salivary gland enlargement has an incidence of 11% (33/298 cases) in canine spirocercosis. Small breeds (≤ 12 kg) and particularly fox terrier breeds are over-represented in the group demonstrating sialorrhoea and this appeared to be the only risk factor. The conclusion was that sialorrhoea secondary to canine spirocercosis occurs frequently and its presence should prompt further investigation for oesophageal and gastro-intestinal disease. Severely affected patients can be managed with phenobarbitone to control the dysphagia in addition to the routine macrocyclic lactones treatment. © 2012. The Authors.},

Contrast study radiography found gas in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and contrast medium left in the esophagus while abdominal ultrasonography was unremarkable. Oropharyngeal and upper GI endoscopy confirmed cervical esophageal dilatation. The dog did not respond to symptomatic treatment. Sialadenosis was diagnosed based on the clinical signs and the ruling out of other diseases with a similar presentation. Medical treatment with phenobarbital was initiated at a dosage of 1.5 mg/kg orally twice daily for 3 months. The clinical signs diminished in a few days and were completely absent within 2 weeks. The mandibular salivary glands were smaller and softened after 2 weeks of treatment. After 3 months, phenobarbital dosage was tapered (reduced) every month and withdrawn at 6 months. Seven months after treatment, the mandibular salivary gland could not be palpated and the dog gained weight and had no clinical signs.

   abstract = {Background: Phenobarbital-responsive sialadenosis (PRS) can cause nausea and vomiting, and is rarely reported in dogs. Objectives: An 8-year-old neutered, male Pomeranian dog was presented to our teaching hospital with vomiting that began 2 years ago. The clinical signs repeatedly improved and deteriorated despite treatment. Methods: The only abnormality found on physical examination was salivary gland enlargement, and no specific findings were observed on blood analysis and imaging tests. The results of the fine needle aspirate cytology from the salivary glands revealed possible sialadenosis. Phenobarbital was prescribed, and the patient's symptoms resolved. However, upon discontinuing drug, the patient's clinical signs recurred and did not improve even after re-introduction of phenobarbital and the addition of other anticonvulsant drugs. An oesophageal stricture was observed on an oesophagram, and fibrosis was confirmed endoscopically. A balloon dilation was performed to expand the stenosis. Results: After the first procedure, the patient's clinical signs initially improved, but relapsed 2 weeks later. A total of three oesophageal dilation procedures were performed using a sequentially larger diameter balloon. After the third procedure, the patient's clinical signs were managed without recurrence. The cause of recurrent gastrointestinal signs following the initial successful treatment of phenobarbital-responsive sialadenosis was due to oesophageal stricture formation. Conclusions: This case report demonstrates the successful management of PRS with subsequent oesophageal stricture formation in a dog.},

   abstract = {Background: Chronic vomiting is a common problem in dogs that has many causes. Ultrasonographic descriptions of many gastrointestinal (GI) diseases have been published. However, diagnostic utility of ultrasonography in dogs with chronic vomiting has not been investigated. Hypothesis: Diagnostic utility of abdominal ultrasound will be highest in dogs with GI neoplasia and lowest in those with inflammatory disorders. Animals: Eighty-nine pet dogs with chronic vomiting. Methods: Medical records were reviewed and the contribution of abdominal ultrasound to the clinical diagnosis was subjectively scored. Results: In 68.5% of dogs, the reviewers thought that the same diagnosis would have been reached without performing ultrasonography. In 22.5% of dogs, the ultrasound examination was considered to be vital or beneficial to the diagnosis. Univariable analysis identified that increased diagnostic utility was associated with increasing age, a greater number of vomiting episodes per week, presence of weight loss, a greater percentage of lost body weight, and a final diagnosis of GI lymphoma or gastric adenocarcinoma. However, multivariate analysis only identified increasing age and a final diagnosis of gastric adenocarcinoma or GI lymphoma to be associated with increased diagnostic utility. In 12.4% of dogs, additional benefits of ultrasonography to case management, excluding the contribution to the vomiting problem, were identified. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: The diagnostic utility of abdominal ultrasonography was high in 27% of dogs. The presence of factors that are associated with high diagnostic utility is an indication to perform abdominal ultrasonography in dogs with chronic vomiting. © 2010 by the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine.},

A cohort study including fifty-four dogs with AP diagnosed using compatible clinical and laboratory parameters, abnormal SNAP cPL and compatible abdominal ultrasound within 48 h from admission, was conducted. Dogs with history of renal and/or urinary diseases were excluded, along with dogs exposed to nephrotoxic drugs. Serum urea and creatinine and urinary output (UO) were recorded. Acute kidney injury (AKI) was diagnosed and graded using International Renal Interest Society (IRIS) guidelines. SDMA was measured using high performance liquid chromatography. Fifty-four dogs were included and divided in non-AKI (n = 37) and AKI dogs (n = 17). Twenty-three dogs (14 non-AKI) had SDMA > 15 g/dL. Median SDMA was higher in AKI dogs than non-AKI dogs (25.7 vs. 13.93 g/dL; p = 0.03). Dogs with normal creatinine (AP and AKI 1 dogs) had SDMA above reference range in 38% and 33% of cases, respectively. In AKI dogs, SDMA and creatinine were positively correlated (p = 0.006 r = 0.7). SDMA was not significantly dierent between survivors and non-survivors. Although further studies are warranted, SDMA may be a useful tool in canine AP, as a high SDMA may be related to subclinical kidney impairment.},

HF scores are used in human medicine to indirectly stage and monitor HF, decreasing the need for liver biopsy. We developed a canine HF score to screen for moderate or greater HF. We included 96 dogs in our study, including 5 healthy dogs. A liver biopsy for histologic examination and a biochemistry profile were performed on all dogs. The dogs were randomly split into a training set of 58 dogs and a validation set of 38 dogs. A HF score that included alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, potassium, and gamma-glutamyl transferase was developed in the training set. Model performance was confirmed using the internal validation set, and was similar to the performance in the training set. The overall sensitivity and specificity for the study group were 80% and 70% respectively, with an area under the curve of 0.80 (0.71–0.90). This HF score could be used for indirect diagnosis of canine HF when biochemistry panels are performed on the Konelab 30i (Thermo Scientific), using reagents as in our study. External validation is required to determine if the score is sufficiently robust to utilize biochemical results measured in other laboratories with different instruments and methodologies.},

This makes diagnosis of the disease difficult and needs to be done to correctly diagnose the underlying cause of the disease. Diagnosis of liver diseases is based on initial formation and physical examination. Findings of liver diseases; weakness, fatigue, swelling of the abdomen, pain and nausea. In addition to clinical findings to diagnose liver diseases, existing tests called liver tests such as blood tests, hepatic enzymes, protein metabolism, lipid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism and bilirubin urine analysis are used as additional diagnostic tests and include abdominal radiography, abdominal ultrasonography, nuclear scintigraphy, Such as computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and kallistatin levels are commonly used tests in liver diseases.

   abstract = {Urinalysis is the examination of normal and abnormal constituents of urine. It is an easy, cheap, and vital initial diagnostic test for veterinarians. Complete urinalysis includes the examination of color, odor, turbidity, volume, pH, specific gravity, protein, glucose, ketones, blood, erythrocytes, leukocytes, epithelial cells, casts, crystal, and organisms. Semi-quantitative urine analysis with urine dipsticks, as well as an automatic analyzer, provides multiple biochemical data. Contamination is almost entirely avoided if the protocols for ensuring a proper sample have been followed, as mentioned still consideration must be given to the likelihood of contamination, even if the sample is correctly obtained. Interpretation of urinalysis will be doubtful if the knowledge of the interference is limited. Well-standardized urinalysis, when correlated in the context of history, clinical findings, and other diagnostic test results, can identify both renal and non-renal disease. This paper reviews significance of different components of urinalysis of dog and cat, such as collection, storage, examination, interpretation, and common causes of error in the result.},

Its assessment includes evaluation of physical characteristics (color, clarity, and volume), biochemical parameters (urine pH, blood, glucose, ketones, bilirubin, urobilinogen, and protein) and microscopic sediment evaluation (RBC, WBC, organisms, epithelial cells, crystals, and casts). Many of these parameters are influenced by collection method and therefore, it is essential to interpret accordingly. Knowledge of factors that can interfere with the accuracy of some test results can decrease improper interpretation. When all of these parameters are evaluated in combination with clinical signs, physical examination, thorough history and other laboratory tests, a diagnosis will often be attained. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

   abstract = {The present investigation was conducted in the Department of Veterinary Medicine, GBPUA&T, Pantnagar during January 2011 to December 2013 with the objective of early diagnosis of renal failure in canine by simple laboratory procedure of urinalysis. Microscopic examination of urine showed a significant increase in cellular component, urinary casts and crystals. The predominant crystals in the urine samples were triple struvite-47.83% (11/23), followed by calcium oxalates-26.09% (6/23), ammonium biurate-13.04% (3/23), amorphous-8.70% (2/23) and lowest was bilirubin-4.35% (1/23). Urolith was present in 23% cases of dogs commonly in male-86.96% (20/23) under 8 years of age-78.26% (18/23). The chemical analysis of stones revealed phosphate, oxalate and ammonia suggested struvite, calcium oxalate and urate. Topography of urinary calculi under scanning electron microscopy was columnar shaped aggregation of crystallites, suggesting calcium oxalates. Approximately 70% of dogs with struvite urolithiasis were associated urinary tract infection with urease producing bacteria. Out of 100 dogs with renal impairment, 63.00% were having urinary tract infections. The most prevalent bacteria isolated from urine specimens were Escherichia coli (38.10%), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (20.63%), Proteus spp. (17.46%) and Streptococcus spp. (6.35%). The most sensitive antibiotics were observed amoxiclav (85.71%), followed by gentamicin (76.19%) and ofloxacin (71.43%).},

   abstract = {Introduction: Current point-of-care testing for canine-specific pancreatic lipase (CPL) provides semi-quantitative measurements with binary results. Recently, a commercial point-of-care testing method (Vcheck CPL) that offers quantitative measurement of CPL has emerged. However, clinical studies on its value (or utility) are limited. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the clinical utility of this commercial point-of-care CPL in diagnosing dogs with suspected acute pancreatitis and to assess its correlation with a commercial semi-quantitative test and other clinicopathological variables. Methods: A prospective observational study included 33 dogs with suspected acute pancreatitis and 20 clinically healthy dogs. Serum Vcheck CPL and SNAP ® cPL were tested, and clinical consensus scores were determined by 5 internists. Eleven dogs with suspected acute pancreatitis underwent follow-up testing during hospitalization. The intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) was used for statistical analysis to assess the agreement between assays and the internists’ consensus score. Results: Dogs with suspected acute pancreatitis had significantly higher serum Vcheck CPL (median: 843 μg/L, range: 77–2001, p < 0.0001) than healthy control dogs (median: 94 μg/L, range: 49–294). By day 3 of hospitalization, serum Vcheck CPL had significantly decreased in dogs with suspected acute pancreatitis compared to day 1. The ICC score between the clinical consensus score, Vcheck CPL, and SNAP ® cPL was 0.75, indicating good agreement. Serum Vcheck CPL concentration was significantly correlated with serum concentrations of amylase, lipase, creatinine, ALP, and CRP. Discussion: This study found good agreement between Vcheck CPL and SNAP ® cPL. This quantitative Vcheck CPL testing could serve as an adjunctive tool in diagnosing dogs with acute pancreatitis.},

   abstract = {Importance: Early diagnosis of canine pancreatitis is challenging due to non-specific clinical signs. Currently, abdominal ultrasonography and measurement of canine pancreatic lipase (cPL) have been employed for the diagnosis of pancreatitis. Objective: Many qualitative and quantitative commercial cPL tests have been developed and used in veterinary clinics. This study aimed to compare three different methodologies SNAP cPL, Spec cPL, and Vcheck cPL tests to assess the concordance of these assays. Methods: Fifty serum samples were collected from 36 dogs with or without pancreatitis and subjected to SNAP cPL, Spec cPL, and Vcheck cPL tests. Agreement and correlation coefficients were calculated between the test results, and correlations were determined during the management of the patients. Results: The results of the three cPL assays were strongly correlated in 47/50 serum samples (94%). Cohen’s kappa analysis between the Spec cPL and Vcheck cPL showed near perfect agreement (κ = 0.960, p < 0.001), SNAP cPL and Vcheck cPL (κ = 0.920, p < 0.001), and Spec cPL and SNAP cPL (κ = 0.880, p < 0.001). The correlation coefficients (r) between data from Spec cPL and Vcheck cPL tests was calculated by Spearman’s correlation test (r = 0.958, p < 0.001). Furthermore, the patterns of change in serum cPL concentrations determined using Spec cPL and Vcheck cPL were significantly consistent during the monitoring period in 11 patients. Conclusions and Relevance: Our data illustrated that Spec cPL and Vcheck cPL tests are compatible for clinical use in the diagnosis and monitoring of canine pancreatitis.},

Hypothesis: (1) The low-dose ACTH stimulation test will provide comparable results to the standard-dose ACTH stimulation test in dogs suspected of hypoadrenocorticism and (2) partial ACTH deficiency exists in dogs and can result in chronic, intermittent gastrointestinal signs. Animals: Thirty-one client-owned dogs suspected of having hypoadrenocorticism. Methods: Prospective study. Dogs suspected of having hypoadrenocorticism received 1 μg/kg cosyntropin IV for the first ACTH stimulation test; the second test was performed 4 h later and dogs received 5 μg/kg cosyntropin IV. Blood samples were obtained pre-ACTH and 1 hour post-ACTH for each dose (4 measurements total). Samples for endogenous ACTH measurement were obtained at the time of initial blood collection. Results: No significant difference was observed in the basal cortisol concentration before administration of a 1 μg/kg versus before a 5 μg/kg dose of cosyntropin (P =.544). For dogs suspected of having hypoadrenocorticism, the ACTH-stimulated cortisol concentrations in response to both doses of ACTH were equivalent (90% confidence interval [CI], 80.5-97.2%; P =.04). No cases with partial ACTH deficiency were identified conclusively. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: A 1 μg/kg dose of cosyntropin is equivalent to a 5 μg/kg dose of cosyntropin for screening dogs suspected of hypoadrenocorticism. The existence of partial ACTH deficiency was not identified in this small group of dogs.},

Methods: Medical records were searched to identify dogs diagnosed with hypoadrenocorticism between January 2004 and June 2014. Dogs were excluded if their Na:K ratio was less than 27 or if they had received prior therapy that could interfere with adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation testing. Results: Forty dogs were included in Group 1 and nine dogs in Group 2. In Group 1, the most common biochemical abnormalities were hypoalbuminaemia (87%) and hypocholesterolaemia (76%). Of 35 dogs in Group 1 with follow-up biochemistry results, five (14%) developed electrolyte abnormalities at 2 to 51 months post diagnosis. Of seven dogs in Group 2 with follow-up, glucocorticoid therapy was discontinued in two dogs without return of clinical signs, four dogs were subsequently diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease and one dog continued to have clinical signs despite glucocorticoid treatment. Clinical Significance: Dogs with gastrointestinal signs and hypoalbuminaemia and, or, hypocholesterolaemia should be evaluated for atypical hypoadrenocorticism. Follow-up electrolyte monitoring is recommended because some will develop electrolyte abnormalities. Although dogs in Group 2 had a clinical presentation compatible with atypical hypoadrenocorticism, the diagnosis appears unlikely based on review of follow-up data. Dogs with equivocal adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation results should be evaluated for other underlying diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease. The use of endogenous adrenocorticotropic hormone measurements in these dogs warrants investigation.},

Oropharyngeal and upper GI endoscopy confirmed cervical esophageal dilatation. The dog did not respond to symptomatic treatment. Sialadenosis was diagnosed based on the clinical signs and the ruling out of other diseases with a similar presentation. Medical treatment with phenobarbital was initiated at a dosage of 1.5 mg/kg orally twice daily for 3 months. The clinical signs diminished in a few days and were completely absent within 2 weeks. The mandibular salivary glands were smaller and softened after 2 weeks of treatment. After 3 months, phenobarbital dosage was tapered (reduced) every month and withdrawn at 6 months. Seven months after treatment, the mandibular salivary gland could not be palpated and the dog gained weight and had no clinical signs. This is the first case of phenobarbital-responsive sialadenosis reported in Thailand.},

Its body condition score was 3/9, and severe atrophy of the temporal/masticatory muscle, trismus, and enophthalmos was observed on physical examination. The radiographic examination and fluoroscopic oesophagography revealed a type 1 hiatal hernia with gastroesophageal reflux. The serology tests revealed increased muscle enzyme activities. The antibody tests for acetylcholine receptor, type 2M fibre, and infectious agents were negative. A conventional surgical treatment was performed, and a thickened, stretched, and flaccid diaphragmatic muscle and an extended inelastic oesophageal hiatus were observed. On the histological examination of the diaphragmatic muscle, a diffuse histiocytic myositis was confirmed. Although the postoperative gastroesophageal reflux totally disappeared, the oesophageal motility and clinical signs did not improve significantly. Medical treatment with immunosuppressive agents was attempted and was effective in alleviating the clinical signs and abnormal oesophageal motility. The health condition of the dog was adequately maintained in the 12-month monitoring period. These findings suggest that, although the medical and surgical treatment have different therapeutic effects, they should be considered simultaneously for the management of a hiatal hernia associated with polymyopathy in dogs.},

Study design: In vivo experimental pilot study and prospective clinical study. Animals: Five purpose-bred Beagles and 20 dogs diagnosed with BAOS. Methods: Respiratory and digestive clinical signs as well as respiratory and GEJ abnormalities were scored. The presence of SHH was investigated using radiography and endoscopy in standard conditions. Endoscopic investigation was repeated after manipulations including manual pressure on the cranial abdomen (MP), Trendelenburg position (30°), or temporary complete endotracheal tube obstruction (ETO). Results: No SHH was detected in any normal dog under any condition. Sixty-five percent of dogs with BAOS presented with digestive clinical signs, including vomiting and/or regurgitation. SHH was observed in only one dog via radiography and was not detected via endoscopy. Manipulations during endoscopy influenced GEJ abnormalities and allowed the detection of SHH in 2 (30°), 4 (ETO), and 5 (MP) dogs, respectively. Digestive clinical signs correlated with GEJ abnormalities observed only in dogs with ETO (P =.02). Conclusion: Manipulations aimed at increasing the transdiaphragmatic pressure gradient during endoscopy in BAOS dogs allowed the detection of GEJ abnormalities and SHH that were not detected under standard conditions. Although MP allowed detection of SHH in more dogs than ETO, scores under MP did not correlate with digestive clinical signs. Therefore, ETO may be more accurate manipulation for the detection of GEJ abnormalities in BAOS dogs.},

   abstract = {Spirocercosis is a disease occurring predominantly in Canidae, caused by the nematode Spirocerca lupi. Typical clinical signs are regurgitation, vomiting and dyspnoea. The life-cycle involves an intermediate (coprophagous beetle) and a variety of paratenic hosts. Larvae follow a specific migratory route, penetrating the gastric mucosa of the host, migrating along arteries, maturing in the thoracic aorta before eventually moving to the caudal oesophagus. Here the worm lives in nodules and passes larvated eggs which can be detected using zinc sulphate faecal flotation. Histologically, the mature oesophageal nodule is composed mostly of actively dividing fibroblasts. Spirocerca lupi-associated oesophageal sarcomas may occur and damage to the aorta results in aneurysms. A pathognomonic lesion for spirocercosis is spondylitis of the thoracic vertebrae. Primary radiological lesions include an oesophageal mass, usually in the terminal oesophagus, spondylitis, and undulation of the aortic border. Contrast radiography and computed tomography are helpful additional emerging modalities. Oesophageal endoscopy has a greater diagnostic sensitivity than radiography. Endoscopic biopsies are not sensitive for detecting neoplastic transformation. Doramectin is the current drug of choice, effectively killing adult worms and decreasing egg shedding. Early diagnosis of infection is still a challenge and to date no ideal regimen for prophylaxis has been published. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {A cross-sectional study was performed on acutely vomiting dogs to compare the accuracy of radiography and ultrasonography for the diagnosis of small-intestinal mechanical obstruction and to describe several radiographic and ultrasonographic signs to identify their contribution to the final diagnosis. The sample population consisted of 82 adult dogs and small-intestinal obstruction by foreign body was confirmed in 27/82 (33%) dogs by surgery or necropsy. Radiography produced a definitive result (obstructed or not obstructed) in 58/82 (70%) of dogs; ultrasonography produced a definitive result in 80/82 (97%) of dogs. On radiographs, a diagnosis of obstruction was based on detection of segmental small-intestinal dilatation, plication, or detection of a foreign body. Approximately 30% (8/27) of obstructed dogs did not have radiographic signs of segmental small-intestinal dilatation, of which 50% (4/8) were due to linear foreign bodies. The ultrasonographic diagnosis of small-intestinal obstruction was based on detection of an obstructive lesion, sonographic signs of plication or segmental, small-intestinal dilatation. The ultrasonographic presence or absence of moderate-to-severe intestinal diameter enlargement (due to lumen dilatation) of the jejunum (>1.5cm) was a useful discriminatory finding and, when present, should prompt a thorough search for a cause of small-intestinal obstruction. In conclusion, both abdominal radiography and abdominal ultrasonography are accurate for diagnosing small-intestinal obstruction in vomiting dogs and either may be used depending on availability and examiner choice. Abdominal ultrasonography had greater accuracy, fewer equivocal results and provided greater diagnostic confidence compared with radiography. © 2010 Veterinary Radiology & Ultrasound.},

Imaging studies revealed gastrointestinal inflammation in the stomach with mild ulceration with unclear aetiology. The dog did not show any improvement to symptomatic treatments. Additionally, it developed bilateral enlargement of the submandibular salivary glands which were hard in consistency and evident at the second presentation at 10 days after the first. Treatment with oral phenobarbital brought rapid resolution of clinical signs. Until recently, the pathogenesis of sialadenosis and why it does respond to phenobarbital have not been well understood.

The aims of this retrospective study were to describe anatomical variations of the major SGs found on MRI and computed tomography (CT) studies of the head in dogs and cats and to investigate possible clinical relevancy. No anatomical variation of the SGs was seen in cats, but in dogs, although variation of the parotid SG was not identified, that of the mandibular SG was found in 33/1680 animals (2%), either unilaterally (6/33 right-sided, 13/33 left-sided) or bilaterally (14/33). The Border terrier breed (19/33, 58%) was over-represented. Each atypically located mandibular SG was positioned medial to the digastric muscle and rostral to the retropharyngeal lymph node. The sublingual glands were difficult to delineate from the mandibular glands. Anatomical variation of one zygomatic gland (3/4 left-sided) was identified in four small-breed dogs (0.2%). Each atypically located zygomatic gland was tilted at the ventrorostral aspect of the masseter muscle underneath the skin surface. MRI and CT characteristics were not different between typically and atypically located SGs. None of the dogs had clinical signs related with SG disease. It was concluded that, with suspected breed predispositions, incidental unilateral or bilateral anatomical variations of mandibular and zygomatic SGs can be encountered in dogs and an awareness of these possible variations may be important in pre-surgical planning.},

   abstract = {Sialoceles are an uncommon canine salivary gland disease, and complete surgical resection is important for a positive outcome. Radiographic sialography has been described as a diagnostic test for presurgical planning; however, superimposition artifacts may limit the diagnosis and detection of all affected glands. Computed tomographic (CT) sialography is a promising technique for delineating the salivary gland apparatus. The aims of this retrospective, observational study were to describe clinical and CT sialographic findings in a group of dogs with confirmed sialoceles, to determine the sensitivity of CT sialography for detecting affected salivary glands using surgery as the reference standard and to determine interobserver agreement for CT sialographic assessments. Dogs were included if they underwent a CT sialography study followed by surgical resection of the diseased gland(s) and histopathological analysis. Computed tomography sialography studies of dogs with surgically confirmed sialoceles (n = 22) were reviewed by a European College of Veterinary Diagnostic Imaging (ECVDI)-certified radiologist and an ECVDI resident. Interobserver agreement was calculated using Cohen's kappa statistics. CT sialography results were compared to surgical findings to determine sensitivity. Contrast leakage was detected in 12 of 22 dogs (54.5%), with intrasialocele leakage being most frequently observed (7/12, 58.3%). There was substantial agreement (κ = 0.70) between reviewers identifying diseased glands, substantial agreement (κ = 0.62) on the diagnostic quality, and no to slight agreement (к = 0.13) in the detection of contrast leakage. The overall sensitivity of CT sialography to detect surgically confirmed diseased glands was 66.7% (95% confidence interval: 48.8-80.8). In conclusion, these findings support the use of CT sialography as an adjunct diagnostic test for treatment planning in dogs with sialoceles.},

   abstract = {Electroencephalography (EEG) is the gold standard for confirming epileptic seizures in both human and veterinary patients. Despite idiopathic epilepsy being one of the most common neurological conditions in dogs, our understanding of it in veterinary medicine lags that in human medicine. The relative underuse of EEG in dogs with seizures has potential causes including practical issues, financial concerns, lack of training/equipment, and questions of clinical value. This technological underuse may lead to, or result from, major gaps in our understanding of EEG in veterinary patients. This underutilization of EEG is of significant clinical relevance because the diagnosis of specific epilepsy syndromes in humans guides the treatment, namely pharmacological, dietary, or surgical. These epilepsy syndromes are diagnosed based on several factors, one of which is the characteristic electrical brain activity on EEG. The aim of this narrative literature review was to highlight the study of cortical brain activity to improve our understanding of EEG in veterinary medicine. Specifically, the utility of EEG with focus on the existing proposed electrode arrays and their current supporting evidence. A recent survey study confirmed that a variety of canine EEG protocols are concurrently in use, including diverse electrode arrays. By comparison, in humans there is a standardized 10–20 electrode array, with average localization error of 13–17 mm depending on the number of placed electrodes on the scalp. We offer a review of the factors that would contribute to the ideal canine EEG electrode array highlighting areas for improvement and future validation. This proposed level of understanding will facilitate the identification of cortical seizure foci with a known degree of error, paving the way for non-pharmaceutical interventions like epilepsy surgeries.},

   abstract = {Background: Canine epilepsy is a chronic common neurologic condition where seizures may be underreported. Electroencephalography (EEG) is the patient-side test providing an objective diagnostic criterion for seizures and epilepsy. Despite this, EEG is thought to be rarely used in veterinary neurology. Objectives: This survey study aims to better understand the current canine EEG usage and techniques and barriers in veterinary neurology. Methods: The online Qualtrics link was distributed via listserv to members of the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine (ACVIM) Neurology Specialty and the European College of Veterinary Neurology (ECVN), reaching at least 517 veterinary neurology specialists and trainees worldwide. Results: The survey received a 35% response rate, for a total of 180 participant responses. Fewer than 50% of veterinary neurologists are currently performing EEG and it is performed infrequently. The most common indication was to determine a discrete event diagnosis. Other reasons included monitoring treatment, determining brain death, identifying the type of seizure or epilepsy, localizing foci, sleep disorders, for research purposes, and post-op brain surgery monitorization. Most respondents interpreted their own EEGs. Clinical barriers to the performance of EEG in dogs were mainly equipment availability, insufficient cases, and financial costs to clients. Conclusion: This survey provides an update on EEG usage and techniques for dogs, identifying commonalities of technique and areas for development as a potential basis for harmonization of canine EEG techniques. A validated and standardized canine EEG protocol is hoped to improve the diagnosis and treatment of canine epilepsy.},

   abstract = {Epilepsy is a common neurological disease in both humans and domestic dogs, making dogs an ideal translational model of epilepsy. In both species, epilepsy is a complex brain disease characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate spontaneous recurrent epileptic seizures. Furthermore, as in humans, status epilepticus is one of the more common neurological emergencies in dogs with epilepsy. In both species, epilepsy is not a single disease but a group of disorders characterized by a broad array of clinical signs, age of onset, and underlying causes. Brain imaging suggests that the limbic system, including the hippocampus and cingulate gyrus, is often affected in canine epilepsy, which could explain the high incidence of comorbid behavioral problems such as anxiety and cognitive alterations. Resistance to antiseizure medications is a significant problem in both canine and human epilepsy, so dogs can be used to study mechanisms of drug resistance and develop novel therapeutic strategies to benefit both species. Importantly, dogs are large enough to accommodate intracranial EEG and responsive neurostimulation devices designed for humans. Studies in epileptic dogs with such devices have reported ictal and interictal events that are remarkably similar to those occurring in human epilepsy. Continuous (24/7) EEG recordings in a select group of epileptic dogs for >1 year have provided a rich dataset of unprecedented length for studying seizure periodicities and developing new methods for seizure forecasting. The data presented in this review substantiate that canine epilepsy is an excellent translational model for several facets of epilepsy research. Furthermore, several techniques of inducing seizures in laboratory dogs are discussed as related to therapeutic advances. Importantly, the development of vagus nerve stimulation as a novel therapy for drug-resistant epilepsy in people was based on a series of studies in dogs with induced seizures. Dogs with naturally occurring or induced seizures provide excellent large-animal models to bridge the translational gap between rodents and humans in the development of novel therapies. Furthermore, because the dog is not only a preclinical species for human medicine but also a potential patient and pet, research on this species serves both veterinary and human medicine.},

   abstract = {Imepitoin has recently been approved in Europe for the management of dogs with idiopathic epilepsy. Currently, there is no evidence-based information available on the efficacy of antiepileptic drugs used as additions to the therapeutic regimen in dogs with idiopathic epilepsy that are not well controlled with imepitoin. The goal of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of phenobarbital or potassium bromide (KBr) as add-on antiepileptic drugs for controlling dogs refractory to a maximum dose of imepitoin (30 mg/kg twice daily). The study was performed as a prospective, randomised, controlled clinical trial. The efficacy of phenobarbital and KBr was evaluated by comparing monthly seizure frequency (MSF), monthly seizure day frequency (MSDF), the presence of cluster seizures during a retrospective 2-month period with a prospective follow-up of 6 months, and the overall responder rate. Twenty-seven dogs were included in the study, 14 dogs in the phenobarbital group and 13 dogs in the KBr group. Both median MSF and MSDF decreased in the phenobarbital group (both P = 0.001) and in the KBr group (P = 0.004 and P = 0.003, respectively). Overall, the number of dogs with cluster seizures decreased (P = 0.0005). The responder rate was 79% vs. 69% in the phenobarbital and KBr groups, respectively. We conclude that phenobarbital or KBr add-on treatment decreases median MSF and MSDF in epileptic dogs refractory to a maximum dose of imepitoin. Combination therapy was generally well tolerated and resulted in an improvement in seizure management in the majority of the dogs.},

   abstract = {Phenobarbital (phenobarbitone) was first used as an antiepileptic drug 100 years ago, in 1912. This article tells the story of the discovery of its antiepileptic action, its early development, and the subsequent course of its clinical use over the 100-year period. The side effects, pharmacokinetics, and misuse of barbiturates are considered, along with the more recent clinical trials and the drug's current clinical utilization. The introduction of controlled drug regulations, the comparative cost of phenobarbital, and its inclusion on the World Health Organization (WHO) essential drug list are discussed. It is one of the few drugs on the formulary in 1912 that is still listed today, and remarkably its efficacy in epilepsy has not been significantly bettered. The current recommendation by the WHO is that phenobarbital should be offered as the first option for therapy for convulsive epilepsy in adults and children if availability can be ensured. This is rated as a strong recommendation because of the proven efficacy and low cost of phenobarbital, and despite its perceived side-effect profile and the practical problems of access. Whether this recommendation puts "a hierarchy on the brain," as has been suggested, is arguable. Much still needs to be learned about the drug's effects, and the issues raised by phenobarbital have lessons for all antiepileptic drug therapy.

Many formulations for a particular drug exist, most of which are marketed for humans. Recently a veterinary specific phenobarbital product has been introduced to the market in the United States. Utilizing a specific formulation to treat patients may help decrease the issue of bioequivalence between one pharmaceutical product to another. Therefore, the goal of this study was to determine single and multiple dosing pharmacokinetics and tolerability of a veterinary specific phenobarbital product over a 4-week time period. Materials and methods: 8 Healthy dogs from a canine research colony were used in the study. Results: Overall, this phenobarbital formulation was well tolerated in the dogs in this study. Cmax, Tmax, half-life, and AUC after single 12 mg/kg oral dose were 23.5 μg/mL, 4.2 h, 94 h, and 2,758 h*μg/mL. Following chronic dosing, these parameters were 29.1 μg/mL, 3.4 h, 70 h, and 2,971 h*μg/mL, respectively. Discussion: This formulation demonstrated a mean absolute bioavailability of 100%, with similar pharmacokinetic properties to previously published data.},

Objectives: We aimed to characterize the hematologic findings and clinical outcomes of dogs that had been receiving phenobarbital at the time of marrow evaluation. Methods: Archived bone marrow slides and clinicopathologic data were reviewed in dogs undergoing marrow evaluation for any hematologic problems that developed while receiving phenobarbital (2008-2020). Dogs were excluded if marrow samples lacked diagnostic value, phenobarbital was withdrawn >1 day before marrow collection, a same-day complete blood count (CBC) was lacking, or dogs had concurrent illness or therapy known to cause cytopenias. Results: Thirteen dogs met inclusion criteria: eight pancytopenic, three anemic/thrombocytopenic, one neutropenic/thrombocytopenic, and one nearly neutropenic. Neutropenia was marked (<700/µL) in eight dogs; all neutrophil concentrations were low or low-normal. Of the 11 anemic dogs (Hct = 12%-42%, median = 29%), three had mild reticulocytosis (eight were tested). One dog had erythroid dysplasia in blood and marrow. All nine neutropenic dogs had evidence of ineffective neutropoiesis: neutrophilic hyperplasia with left shift (9) ± neutrophagocytosis (5). Eight of the 11 anemic dogs had evidence of ineffective erythropoiesis: erythroid hyperplasia (7), left shift (3), and/or rubriphagocytosis (6). No thrombocytopenic dog had megakaryocytic hypoplasia; seven dogs had megakaryocytic hyperplasia. One anemic/thrombocytopenic dog had marked collagen myelofibrosis. The noncytopenic dog had equivocal myeloid hypoplasia with neutrophagocytosis. Median maximal responses and resolution times for neutropenia (n = 6) were 14 days. Conclusions: Phenobarbital-induced cytopenias should be considered in dogs with multilineage ineffective hematopoiesis, particularly when neutropenia and myeloid hyperplasia are present. However, findings in dogs with immune-mediated neutropenia or precursor-targeted immune-mediated anemia might be indistinguishable.},

   abstract = {Phenobarbital (PB) is one of the oldest Antiseizure Medicines (ASMs), which is in clinical use since 1912. Its value in the treatment of Status epilepticus is currently discussed controversially. Phenobarbital has fallen out of favor in many countries across Europe because of reports of hypotension, arrhythmias, and hypopnea. Phenobarbital has a strong antiseizure effect with remarkably little sedation. It exerts its clinical effects, through the increase of GABE-ergic inhibition and decrease of glutamatergic excitation by inhibition of AMPA receptors. Despite good preclinical evidence, there are remarkably few randomized controlled studies on humans in SE, which suggest, that it is at least as good as lorazepam in first-line treatment in early SE, and significantly better than valproic acid in benzodiazepine-resistant SE. Data from randomized trials and large non-randomized prospective and retrospective studies suggest, that Phenobarbital is well tolerated even if used in very high dose protocols. Thus, despite its decline in its popularity at least in Europe and North America, it should be considered a highly cost-effective treatment for early and established SE, not only in resource-limited settings.

The medical records of two veterinary referral institutions were searched for dogs diagnosed with idiopathic epilepsy and treated with PB as monotherapy or polytherapy between March 2003 and September 2010. Sixteen dogs had PBIHA; the median age at diagnosis was 69.5 months. Phenobarbitone was administered at a median dose of 3 mg/kg twice a day for a median period of 100.5 days and the median serum phenobarbitone level was 19 μg/ml. Two dogs had neutropenia, three had anaemia and thrombocytopenia, two had anaemia and neutropenia; the remaining nine had pancytopenia. All dogs were referred for non-specific clinical signs. Phenobarbitone was discontinued after diagnosis, and the median time to resolution of PBIHA was 17 days. The prevalence and risk factors for PBIHA were evaluated from a questionnaire survey of referring practices to obtain more detailed follow-up on cases diagnosed with idiopathic epilepsy. The prevalence rate of PBIHA was 4.2%, and the condition occurred in dogs treated with standard therapeutic doses often within the first three months after starting treatment. Serial haematological evaluations should be therefore considered from the beginning of phenobarbitone therapy to allow early diagnosis and treatment of PBIHA.},

   abstract = {The barbiturate phenobarbital has been in use in the treatment of epilepsy for 100 years. It has long been recognized that barbiturates act by prolonging and potentiating the action of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) on GABA(A) receptors and at higher concentrations directly activating the receptors. A large body of data supports the concept that GABA(A) receptors are the primary central nervous system target for barbiturates, including the finding that transgenic mice with a point mutation in the β3 GABA(A) -receptor subunit exhibit diminished sensitivity to the sedative and immobilizing actions of the anesthetic barbiturate pentobarbital. Although phenobarbital is only modestly less potent as a GABA(A) -receptor modulator than pentobarbital, phenobarbital is minimally sedating at effective anticonvulsant doses. Possible explanations for the reduced sedative effect of phenobarbital include more regionally restricted action; partial agonist activity; reduced propensity to directly activate GABA(A) receptors (possibly including extrasynaptic receptors containing δ subunits); and reduced activity at other ion channel targets, including voltage-gated calcium channels. In recent years, substantial progress has been made in defining the structural features of GABA(A) receptors responsible for gating and allosteric modulation by drugs. Although the precise sites of action of barbiturates have not yet been defined, the second and third transmembrane domains of the β subunit appear to be critical; binding may involve a pocket formed by β-subunit methionine 286 as well as α-subunit methionine 236. In addition to effects on GABA(A) receptors, barbiturates block AMPA/kainate receptors, and they inhibit glutamate release through an effect on P/Q-type high-voltage activated calcium channels. The combination of these various actions likely accounts for their diverse clinical activities. Despite the remarkable progress of the last century, there is still much to learn about the actions of barbiturates that can be applied to the discovery of new, more therapeutically useful agents.

   abstract = {Sialadenosis is a bilateral, painless, noninflammatory, uniform, and nonneoplastic condition reported in human and animal medicine. It is a rare condition in animal medicine with only a handful of case reports published to date. According to the different case reviews in the veterinary literature, it can be classified under different forms that are associated with enlargement of a salivary gland with gastrointestinal diseases or without any other abnormality and also phenobarbital responsive or non-responsive form. Phenobarbital-responsive sialadenosis associated with an oesophagal foreign body has also been reported in a dog. This communication presents a case report of phenobarbital responsive sialadenosis of a ten-month old male Rottweiler. This dog was presented with the main complaint of acute vomiting together with inappetence, gulping, and progressive weight loss. Imaging studies revealed gastrointestinal inflammation in the stomach with mild ulceration with unclear aetiology. The dog did not show any improvement to symptomatic treatments. Additionally, it developed bilateral enlargement of the submandibular salivary glands which were hard in consistency and evident at the second presentation at 10 days after the first. Treatment with oral phenobarbital brought rapid resolution of clinical signs. Until recently, the pathogenesis of sialadenosis and why it does respond to phenobarbital have not been well understood. Because of the response to phenobarbital treatments, sialadenosis may represent a form of limbic epilepsy or peripheral autonomic dysfunction.},

Physical examination revealed pale pink mucous membranes and peripheral lymphadenomegaly. Haematology showed a regenerative anaemia (haematocrit 19.3%, reticulocyte count 118.08 ×109/l), and saline agglutination was positive. Infectious disease screening was negative and lymph node cytology was consistent with reactive lymphoid hyperplasia. A diagnosis of phenobarbital-induced reactive lymphoid hyperplasia and immune-mediated anaemia was suspected. Complete resolution of the lymphadenomegaly and anaemia was documented within 4 weeks of phenobarbital discontinuation. Relevance and novel information: There are limited case reports of phenobarbital-induced haematological changes and lymphadenomegaly; however, the combination has not previously been reported in cats and is similar to the rare but significant syndrome in humans known as ‘anticonvulsant hypersensitivity syndrome’. Anticonvulsant hypersensitivities should be considered as a potentially serious, yet reversible, sequela to phenobarbital treatment that may be mistaken for more severe illness such as neoplasia.},

Objectives: We aimed to characterize the hematologic findings and clinical outcomes of dogs that had been receiving phenobarbital at the time of marrow evaluation. Methods: Archived bone marrow slides and clinicopathologic data were reviewed in dogs undergoing marrow evaluation for any hematologic problems that developed while receiving phenobarbital (2008-2020). Dogs were excluded if marrow samples lacked diagnostic value, phenobarbital was withdrawn >1 day before marrow collection, a same-day complete blood count (CBC) was lacking, or dogs had concurrent illness or therapy known to cause cytopenias. Results: Thirteen dogs met inclusion criteria: eight pancytopenic, three anemic/thrombocytopenic, one neutropenic/thrombocytopenic, and one nearly neutropenic. Neutropenia was marked (<700/µL) in eight dogs; all neutrophil concentrations were low or low-normal. Of the 11 anemic dogs (Hct = 12%-42%, median = 29%), three had mild reticulocytosis (eight were tested). One dog had erythroid dysplasia in blood and marrow. All nine neutropenic dogs had evidence of ineffective neutropoiesis: neutrophilic hyperplasia with left shift (9) ± neutrophagocytosis (5). Eight of the 11 anemic dogs had evidence of ineffective erythropoiesis: erythroid hyperplasia (7), left shift (3), and/or rubriphagocytosis (6). No thrombocytopenic dog had megakaryocytic hypoplasia; seven dogs had megakaryocytic hyperplasia. One anemic/thrombocytopenic dog had marked collagen myelofibrosis. The noncytopenic dog had equivocal myeloid hypoplasia with neutrophagocytosis. Median maximal responses and resolution times for neutropenia (n = 6) were 14 days. Conclusions: Phenobarbital-induced cytopenias should be considered in dogs with multilineage ineffective hematopoiesis, particularly when neutropenia and myeloid hyperplasia are present. However, findings in dogs with immune-mediated neutropenia or precursor-targeted immune-mediated anemia might be indistinguishable.},

   abstract = {Phenobarbital is the drug of choice for control of canine epilepsy. Phenobarbital induces hepatic enzyme activity, can be hepatotoxic, and decreases serum thyroxine (T4) concentrations in some dogs. The duration of liver enzyme induction and T4 concentration decreases after discontinuation of phenobarbital is unknown. The purpose of this study was to characterize the changes in serum total T4 (TT4), free T4 (FT4), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), cholesterol and albumin concentrations, and activities in serum of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) after discontinuation of long-term phenobarbital administration in normal dogs. Twelve normal dogs were administered phenobarbital at a dosage of approximately 4.4-6.6 mg/kg PO q12h for 27 weeks. Blood was collected for analysis before and after 27 weeks of phenobarbital administration and then weekly for 10 weeks after discontinuation of the drug. The dogs were clinically normal throughout the study period. Serum ALT and ALP activity and TSH and cholesterol concentrations were significantly higher than baseline at week 27. Serum T4 and FT4 were significantly lower. Serum albumin and GGT were not changed from baseline at week 27. Changes in estimate of thyroid function (TT4, FT4, TSH) persisted for 1-4 weeks after discontinuation of phenobarbital, whereas changes in hepatic enzyme activity (ALT, ALP) and cholesterol concentration resolved in 3-5 weeks. To avoid false positive results, it is recommended that thyroid testing be performed at least 4 weeks after discontinuation of phenobarbital administration. Elevated serum activity of hepatic enzymes 6-8 weeks after discontinuation of phenobarbital may indicate hepatic disease.},

   abstract = {Long-term administration of phenobarbital has been reported to cause hepatic injury in dogs. Phenobarbital induces hepatic enzymes, and it may be difficult to distinguish the effect of enzyme induction on serum liver enzyme activities from actual hepatic damage. The hepatotoxicity of phenobarbital and the impact of enzyme induction on serum liver enzyme activity were investigated prospectively in 12 normal dogs. Phenobarbital was administered for 29 weeks at 5 mg per kilogram of body weight (range, 4.8-6.6 mg/kg) PO q12h, resulting in therapeutic serum phenobarbital concentrations (20-40 microg/mL). Serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), fasted bile acids (fBA), total bilirubin, and albumin were determined before and during treatment. Lateral abdominal radiographs, abdominal ultrasounds, and histopathologic examinations of liver tissue obtained by ultrasound-guided biopsy were performed before and during treatment. Radiographs revealed a moderate increase in liver size in most dogs. Ultrasonographic examination revealed no change in liver echogenicity or architecture. No evidence of morphologic liver damage was observed histopathologically. ALP and ALT increased significantly (P < .05), GGT increased transiently, and albumin decreased transiently during the study. There were no significant changes in AST, bilirubin, and fBA. These results suggest that increases in serum ALP, ALT, and GGT may reflect enzyme induction rather than hepatic injury during phenobarbital treatment in dogs. Serum AST, fBA, and bilirubin, and ultrasonographic evaluation of the liver are not affected by the enzyme-inducing effect of phenobarbital and can therefore be helpful to assess liver disease in dogs treated with the drug.},

Oral intake of sodium chloride as well as renal function influence this half-life time and may have an influence on the needed dose to get proper serum levels. The hypothesis is that dogs living close to coastal areas require a greater potassium bromide dose than dogs living more inland. The main study objective was to determine the relationship between bromide dose, serum bromide concentration, treatment duration, type of food, concurrent therapies and the proximity of the dog's residency to a coastal area. A retrospective cross-sectional study was performed. A total of 658 bromide serum measurements were retrieved from the veterinary faculty's laboratory archive, Utrecht University, The Netherlands. Information on the bromide dose, renal function, treatment period, type of food, concurrent therapies and residence was obtained retrospectively from owners of all dogs using a postal survey. A dataset of 220 unique study units was created. The dogs were grouped based on their residence (proximity to the coast > or <50 km). Differences between the groups of dogs regarding bromide dose, serum bromide concentration, treatment duration, type of food and concurrent therapies were analyzed to evaluate the effect of residence on bromide dose and serum concentration. Results: Although not statistically significant there is a trend that dogs living in close proximity to the sea may require a higher dose of potassium bromide to maintain therapeutic concentrations compared to dogs living more inlands. Additional studies are needed to further explore this observation.},

   abstract = {Background: Bromide is a halide ion of the element bromine usually administered in the form of potassium salt as monotherapy or add-on treatment in epileptic dogs. It is excreted unchanged in the urine and undergoes tubular reabsorption in competition with chloride. Thus, dietary chloride content affects serum bromide concentrations. This is the first published clinical report of bromide toxicosis secondary to a dietary modification of chloride content in an epileptic dog treated with potassium bromide. Case presentation: A 3-year-old 55-kg neutered male Tibetan Mastiff was evaluated because of a 1-month history of progressive signs including ataxia, lethargy and behaviour changes. The dog was successfully treated for idiopathic epilepsy since the age of 1-year-old with phenobarbital and potassium bromide. Two months prior to presentation, the owners decided to change the dog’s diet without veterinary advice. Physical examination was unremarkable. A 12-kg weight gain was recorded since last follow-up (8 months). Neurological examination revealed severe symmetric 4-limbs ataxia with altered vigilance and intermittent episodes of hyperactivity and aggressive behaviour without significant abnormality of cranial nerves. Serum bromide concentration was high and increased by 103 % since last follow-up. Nutritional evaluation revealed a 53 % decrease of chloride content in the diet before and after dietary transition. Bromide toxicosis was suspected, due to bromide reduced clearance secondary to the decreased dietary chloride content. Potassium bromide treatment was lowered by 15 % without further dietary changes. Neurologic signs progressively improved over the next month, without any seizure. After two months, the serum bromide concentration lowered to the same level measured before dietary modification. After four months, neurological examination was unremarkable. Conclusions: Dietary chloride content can directly influence serum bromide concentrations, therefore affecting seizure control or contributing to unexpected adverse effects. In the present case, a reduction in chloride intake markedly increased serum bromide concentrations causing bromism. Dietary changes should be avoided in dogs treated with potassium bromide to maintain stable serum bromide levels.},

Objectives: An 8-year-old neutered, male Pomeranian dog was presented to our teaching hospital with vomiting that began 2 years ago. The clinical signs repeatedly improved and deteriorated despite treatment. Methods: The only abnormality found on physical examination was salivary gland enlargement, and no specific findings were observed on blood analysis and imaging tests. The results of the fine needle aspirate cytology from the salivary glands revealed possible sialadenosis. Phenobarbital was prescribed, and the patient's symptoms resolved. However, upon discontinuing drug, the patient's clinical signs recurred and did not improve even after re-introduction of phenobarbital and the addition of other anticonvulsant drugs. An oesophageal stricture was observed on an oesophagram, and fibrosis was confirmed endoscopically. A balloon dilation was performed to expand the stenosis. Results: After the first procedure, the patient's clinical signs initially improved, but relapsed 2 weeks later. A total of three oesophageal dilation procedures were performed using a sequentially larger diameter balloon. After the third procedure, the patient's clinical signs were managed without recurrence. The cause of recurrent gastrointestinal signs following the initial successful treatment of phenobarbital-responsive sialadenosis was due to oesophageal stricture formation. Conclusions: This case report demonstrates the successful management of PRS with subsequent oesophageal stricture formation in a dog.},

Benzodiazepines and some anticonvulsant agents are drugs of choice for initial SE management. Despite their effectiveness, over 40% of SE cases are refractory to the initial treatment with two or more medications. Thus, there is an unmet need of developing newer anti-SE drugs. Levetiracetam (LEV) is a widely prescribed anti-epileptic drug that has been reported to be used in SE cases, especially in benzodiazepine-resistant SE or where phenytoin cannot be used due to allergic side-effects. Levetiracetam's non-classical anti-epileptic mechanisms of action, favorable pharmacokinetic profile, general lack of central depressant effects, and lower incidence of drug interactions contribute to its use in SE management. This review will focus on LEV's unique mechanism of action that makes it a viable candidate for SE treatment. © 2014 Deshpande and DeLorenzo.},

   abstract = {To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of levetiracetam monotherapy in dogs with structural epilepsy. Retrospective case series. Nineteen client-owned dogs with structural epilepsy. Seizure frequencies after initiation of treatment were used to evaluate the efficacy of levetiracetam monotherapy. Seizure control was considered good if no seizures occurred within three months of starting treatment or poor if seizures returned within one month of starting treatment. Tolerability was evaluated by considering the occurrence and severity of any reported side effects. Ten of the 19 dogs were considered to have a good response to treatment with 7 achieving complete seizure freedom. Nine dogs were considered to have poor response to treatment. There was a statistically significant reduction in the percentage of patients experiencing cluster seizures from 68.4% to 15.8% (p=0.002). Side effects were noted in 8 of the 19 dogs but were considered mild in all cases. Follow-up times ranged from 12 days to 426 days. When used in conjunction with other appropriate therapies, levetiracetam may be an efficacious option for monotherapy in dogs with structural epilepsy. Its tolerability makes it a suitable option for use in a wide variety of patients.},

   abstract = {potential bioequivalence of generic and brand-name ER formulations of levetiracetam in healthy dogs. Our hypothesis was that generic formulations would have similar bioequivalence and pharmacokinetic profiles in dogs, compared with those of brand-name formulations , thereby providing a more cost-efficient, convenient treatment option for epilepsy in this species. Materials and Methods Animals Six client-owned dogs (3 males and 3 females) between 4 and 8 years of age and weighing between 22.0 and 28.0 kg were enrolled in the study. Dogs were determined to be healthy on the basis of unremarkable results of physical and neurologic examinations and clinicopathologic tests (CBC, serum biochemical analysis , and urinalysis). All owners provided informed consent, and the study protocol was approved by the Food was withheld from dogs for at least 12 hours before the experiment began. Dogs were allotted to 2 groups of 3 dogs each to facilitate blood sample collection for formulation assessment. One intact 500-mg tablet of each of 4 formulations of levetiracetam was administered PO to each dog on 4 occasions that were separated by a minimum washout period of 7 days. Formulations included 2 generic products (generic-ER1 a and generic-ER2 b), 1 brand-name ER product c (brand-ER), and 1 brand-name IR product d (brand-IR). Order of product administration was randomized for each dog by use of a predetermined schedule. e Experimental protocol For each administration, a 20-gauge, 1.25-inch intravenous catheter f was inserted into a cephalic vein to facilitate sample collection. Three milliliters of blood was collected from each dog at the time of catheter placement (0 hours) as well as 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, and 36 hours after drug administration. Blood samples were allowed to coagulate for 30 minutes. All samples were then centrifuged g for 10 minutes at 1,489 X g. Serum was harvested by use of pipettes, transferred immediately to 2.0-mL microtubes, and stored at-80°C until analysis. Values of physiologic variables, including heart rate (0 and 0.5 hours), respiration rate (0, 0.25, and 0.5 hours), and arterial blood pressure as measured with the ultrason-ic Doppler method (0, 0.25, and 0.5 hours), were recorded. Adverse effects in dogs, including changes in mentation, behavior, gait, vital signs (eg, heart rate, respiratory rate, and arterial blood pressure), and other overt signs of illness (eg, vomiting or diarrhea), were recorded when identified. Pharmacokinetic analysis Serum from clinically normal, untreated dogs was used for preparation of standard and quality control solutions. The levetiracetam standard (calibration) solution h was serially diluted to 96, 48, 24, 12, 6, 3, 1.5, 0.75, 0.375, and 0.1875 µg/mL. Quality control samples were prepared separately at concentrations of 48, 6, and 0.75 µg/mL. For each sample analysis (serum, standard, quality control, and blank), 25 µL of sample was added to 25 µL of internal standard solution (clon-azepam h [7.12 µg/mL]). Protein was removed from samples by addition of 450 µL of ice-cold acetonitrile, tube contents were mixed by use of a vortex device for 30 seconds, and tubes were centrifuged for 20 minutes at 14,000 X g. A 100-µL aliquot of supernatant was extracted, and 400 µL of mobile phase was added. Contents were then mixed and transferred to an autosampler vial for analysis by means of ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. i Samples (2 µL) were separated on a C18 stationary phase column j with isocratic mobile phase consisting of 0.1% formic acid and acetoni-trile (20:80 [vol:vol]). Measurement of levetiracetam and internal standard (clonazepam) concentrations was performed at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min by use of electrospray ionization. k Results for the method were linear from 1.875 to 480 ng/mL, with a limit of quantification of 1.8 ng/mL; accuracy was > 90%, and variation was ≤ 15%. Nitrogen gas was used as the drying nebulizer and collision gas (10 L/min at 325°C and 2460.7 cm H 2 O). Capillary voltage was set at 3,500 V. Mass spectral data were acquired in positive-ion mode, and mass transitions were monitored by means of multiple reaction monitoring (Appendix). Pharmacokinetic analysis Pharmacokinetic values were estimated from a non-compartmental analysis of serum concentrations of leve-tiracetam after oral administration of brand-IR, brand-ER, generic-ER1, and generic-ER2 by use of statistical model-ing software. l Parameters included Cmax, Tmax, terminal rate constant (β), AUC, half-life, Vd, and Cl. The AUC was estimated by use of the logarithmic trapezoidal method, with extrapolation of the degree of drug exposure from the time of last measured concentration to infinity. Time to maximum serum concentration of levetiracetam was estimated on the basis of data collected at the predetermined sample collection points for generation of drug concentration versus time profiles. The Cmax and AUC were normalized to dose, and Cl and Vd were normalized to F. Published data 6 for dogs and humans suggested that F is equal to 1.0; therefore, Cl and Vd represent good estimates of the fraction of drug absorbed (Cl/F and Vd/F, respectively). Statistical analysis Statistical analysis of data from all dogs that received each formulation of levetiracetam (n = 5 or 6) was performed with the aid of statistical software. m Results are reported as mean ± SD. Estimates of phar-macokinetic variables were compared among formulations by use of 1-way ANOVA. Differences were considered significant at P ≤ 0.05.},

   abstract = {Objectives: Myoclonic seizures are considered a type of generalised seizure characterised by brief, jerking movements of the body. The aim of this study is to describe cases of suspected canine myoclonic seizure of idiopathic aetiology and to discuss the successful use of the anticonvulsant levetiracetam as treatment in each of these cases. Materials and Methods: Dogs with epileptic myoclonus suspected to be idiopathic in aetiology were considered for inclusion. Medical records were reviewed for physical and neurologic examination findings, clinicopathologic results, and diagnostic imaging results. All included dogs were treated with levetiracetam, and their response was reported. Results: Five dogs were included, all of which had suspected myoclonic seizures either observed in-person or on video recording by a board-certified veterinary neurologist. The duration of myoclonic seizures preceding treatment ranged from one day to one year. One dog also experienced a generalised tonic–clonic seizure. All dogs were treated with levetiracetam. Two dogs experienced long-term myoclonic seizure freedom (duration seizure-free of at least 1 year), and two dogs experienced marked decreased myoclonic seizure frequency. One dog experienced immediate abatement of myoclonic seizures, although levetiracetam was only utilised for 1 month following onset of myoclonic seizures in this patient. Clinical Significance: Myoclonic seizures can be idiopathic in aetiology. Levetiracetam can be used effectively to rapidly stop myoclonic seizures and to decrease the frequency of myoclonic seizures.},

   abstract = {Background: Retrospective studies can complement information derived from double-blinded randomized trials. There are multiple retrospective studies reporting good efficacy and tolerability of the anti-epileptic drug levetiracetam (LEV) in human patients with epilepsy; however, reports of LEV's tolerability and efficacy in dogs with epilepsy remain limited. The purpose of this retrospective study was to describe the use of LEV in a canine epilepsy clinic and determine the long-term efficacy and tolerability of LEV in veterinary clinical practice. The electronic database of a UK based referral hospital was searched for LEV usage in dogs with seizures. Information and data necessary for the evaluation were obtained from a combination of electronic and written hospital records, the referring veterinary surgeons' records and telephone interviews with dog owners. Only dogs that were reportedly diagnosed with idiopathic epilepsy were included in the study. Results: Fifty-two dogs were included in this retrospective study. Two treatment protocols were recognised; 29 dogs were treated continuously with LEV and 23 dogs received interval or pulse treatment for cluster seizures. LEV treatment resulted in 69% of dogs having a 50% or greater reduction of seizure frequency whilst 15% of all the dogs were completely free from seizures. Seizure frequency reduced significantly in the whole population. No dog was reported to experience life-threatening side effects. Mild side effects were experienced by 46% of dogs and a significantly higher number of these dogs were in the pulse treatment group. The most common side-effects reported were sedation and ataxia. Conclusions: LEV appears to be effective and well tolerated for reduction of seizures.},

   abstract = {Epilepsy is a chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are used to control seizures. Even though parts of their mechanisms of action are known, there are still components that need to be studied. Therefore, the search for novel drugs, new molecular targets, and a better understanding of the mechanisms of action of existing drugs is still crucial. Levetiracetam (LEV) is an AED that has been shown to be effective in seizure control and is well-tolerable, with a novel mechanism of action through an interaction with the synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A). Moreover, LEV has other molecular targets that involve calcium homeostasis, the GABAergic system, and AMPA receptors among others, that might be integrated into a single mechanism of action that could explain the antiepileptogenic, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, and antioxidant properties of LEV. This puts it as a possible multitarget drug with clinical applications other than for epilepsy. According to the above, the objective of this work was to carry out a comprehensive and integrative review of LEV in relation to its clinical uses, structural properties, therapeutical targets, and different molecular, genetic, and systemic action mechanisms in order to consider LEV as a candidate for drug repurposing.},

Records of eight dogs were used retrospectively to determine a safe, efficient levetiracetam dosage. Fourteen dogs were entered into a prospective, open label, non-comparative study. After 2 months of levetiracetam oral treatment (10 mg/kg TID), 8/14 dogs responded significantly to the treatment and seizure frequency was reduced by ≥50%. In dogs that remained refractory, the dosage was increased to 20 mg/kg TID for 2 months. One further dog responded to levetiracetam treatment. Levetiracetam responders had a significant decrease in seizure frequency of 77% (7.9 ± 5.2 to 1.8 ± 1.7 seizures/month) and a decrease in seizure days per month of 68% (3.8 ± 1.7 to 1.2 ± 1.1 seizure days/month). However, 6/9 responders experienced an increase in seizure frequency and seizure days after 4-8 months continuing with the levetiracetam treatment at the last effective dosage. Levetiracetam was well tolerated by all dogs and sedation was the only side-effect reported in just one of the 14 dogs. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
