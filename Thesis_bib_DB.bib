Although the disease is frequently subclinical, esophageal dysphagia manifested by regurgitation, odynophagia, and hypersalivation is considered the clinical hallmark. Diagnosis should combine fecal analysis, thoracic radiography, and esophagoscopy to look for parasite ova, spondylitis or posterior mediastinal masses, and parasite nodules or tumors, respectively. Two avermectins, doramectin and ivermectin, have been effective in the treatment of canine spirocercosis, resulting in clinical remission, regression, or elimination of esophageal granulomas and cessation of egg shedding.},

              The aim of the study was to describe the anatomical location and the topographic relationship of the major salivary glands to associated tissues in six dog cadavers by high‐field magnetic resonance imaging (
              MRI
              ) and gross anatomical dissections and sections. Spin‐echo T1‐weighted and T2‐weighted magnetic resonance (
              MR
              ) images were obtained in transverse, sagittal, and dorsal planes with a 1.5 T magnet. The digastric muscle, the external auditory canal, the eyeball, and the medial pterygoid muscle were the most consistent topographic landmarks for the identification of the mandibular, parotid, and zygomatic salivary glands, respectively. The best differentiation and contrast of the glands was observed in the T2‐weighted images. In contrast with the osseous and muscular tissues, the salivary glands appeared hyperintense in greater or lesser measure except for the parotid gland, which displayed a hypointense signal. The rostral part of the monostomatic sublingual gland was precisely located between the tongue and the mylohyoid muscle. The best delineation between the caudal part of the monostomatic sublingual gland and the cranial aspect of the mandibular gland was observed in dorsal
              MRI
              at the level of the palate and the branches of the superior dental arcade. Good evaluation of the mandibular, parotid, caudal part of the monostomatic sublingual, zygomatic and buccal ventral glands was possible in sagittal
              MRI
              in close relation with the external auditory canal and the temporomandibular joint. The ventral buccal glands were also observed near the buccal vestibule as was the palatine glands within the soft palate.},

 Objective
 —To determine clinical findings, cytologic
and histologic characteristics of salivary glands, and
response to treatment with phenobarbital in dogs
with clinical signs typical of sialadenosis.
 Design
 —Prospective study.
 Animals
 —13 dogs with enlarged salivary glands.

 Procedure
 —Data were collected from dogs with clinical
signs attributable to enlarged salivary glands.
Salivary gland biopsy and cytologic specimens were
examined. Dogs were treated with phenobarbital and
monitored for response to treatment.
          
 Results
 —Clinical signs commonly associated with
sialadenosis included retching and gulping. Substantial
cellular changes were not detected by histologic
or cytologic examination of enlarged salivary
glands. Response to treatment with phenobarbital
was rapid, although most dogs required continuous
treatment to prevent recurrence of clinical signs.
          
 Conclusions and Clinical Relevance
 —Sialadenosis
is a condition of unknown cause that may have been
underdiagnosed in dogs. Criteria for diagnosis include
typical clinical signs, enlarged salivary glands, and lack
of substantial microscopic lesions. Response to treatment
with phenobarbital is rapid.

As an additional objective, serum cortisol concentrations of saliva samples obtained with or without citric acid and with or without previous pH adjustment were compared. Five clinically healthy were randomly assigned to one of 5 treatments with cottons with different substances: 1) control, 2) citric acid, 3) acetic acid, 4) sodium chloride, 5) sucrose. Each dog received one treatment per day, and in 5 days, all dogs were tested with the five treatments. On each day, cottons were applied to dogs at times 0, 20, 40, 60 and 80 minutes. The cottons with citric acid generated more volume than the rest of the treatments (p{\textless}0.0001), and sodium chloride generated more volume than the control and acetic acid (p≤0.03). Cottons with citric acid generated lower pH of saliva than the rest of the treatments (p{\textless}0.0001). Cottons with acetic acid generated lower pH than control, sodium chloride and sucrose (p{\textless}0.0001). There were no differences in cortisol concentrations between the control samples and those obtained with citric acid, nor between these same samples with and without pH adjusted with buffer. The concentration of proteins in saliva and excitement degree did not change with treatment. Citric acid was more palatable than the rest of the treatments (p{\textless}0.0001). Sodium chloride and sucrose were more palatable than control (p{\textless}0.05). In conclusion, citric acid was the chemical stimulant that generated greater volume of saliva and greater palatability in dogs. Although the pH of the saliva obtained with citric acid was clearly acidic, its acidic pH did not affect the determination of cortisol by chemiluminescence or RIA. Sodium chloride and sucrose allowed to obtain high volumes of saliva and were more palatable than the control, which can be other interesting options to obtain saliva in case of not being able to use citric acid.},

	abstract = {Epilepsy is a common neurological disease in both humans and domestic dogs, making dogs an ideal translational model of epilepsy. In both species, epilepsy is a complex brain disease characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate spontaneous recurrent epileptic seizures. Furthermore, as in humans, status epilepticus is one of the more common neurological emergencies in dogs with epilepsy. In both species, epilepsy is not a single disease but a group of disorders characterized by a broad array of clinical signs, age of onset, and underlying causes. Brain imaging suggests that the limbic system, including the hippocampus and cingulate gyrus, is often affected in canine epilepsy, which could explain the high incidence of comorbid behavioral problems such as anxiety and cognitive alterations. Resistance to antiseizure medications is a significant problem in both canine and human epilepsy, so dogs can be used to study mechanisms of drug resistance and develop novel therapeutic strategies to benefit both species. Importantly, dogs are large enough to accommodate intracranial EEG and responsive neurostimulation devices designed for humans. Studies in epileptic dogs with such devices have reported ictal and interictal events that are remarkably similar to those occurring in human epilepsy. Continuous (24/7) EEG recordings in a select group of epileptic dogs for {\textgreater}1 year have provided a rich dataset of unprecedented length for studying seizure periodicities and developing new methods for seizure forecasting. The data presented in this review substantiate that canine epilepsy is an excellent translational model for several facets of epilepsy research. Furthermore, several techniques of inducing seizures in laboratory dogs are discussed as related to therapeutic advances. Importantly, the development of vagus nerve stimulation as a novel therapy for drug-resistant epilepsy in people was based on a series of studies in dogs with induced seizures. Dogs with naturally occurring or induced seizures provide excellent large-animal models to bridge the translational gap between rodents and humans in the development of novel therapies. Furthermore, because the dog is not only a preclinical species for human medicine but also a potential patient and pet, research on this species serves both veterinary and human medicine.},

	abstract = {The lack of therapeutics that prevent the development of epilepsy, improve disease prognosis or overcome drug resistance represents an unmet clinical need in veterinary as well as in human medicine. Over the past decade, experimental studies and studies in human epilepsy patients have demonstrated that neuroinflammatory processes are involved in epilepsy development and play a key role in neuronal hyperexcitability that underlies seizure generation. Targeting neuroinflammatory signaling pathways may provide a basis for clinically relevant disease-modification strategies in general, and moreover, could open up new therapeutic avenues for human and veterinary patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. A sound understanding of the neuroinflammatory mechanisms underlying seizure pathogenesis in canine patients is therefore essential for mechanism-based discovery of selective epilepsy therapies that may enable the development of new disease-modifying treatments. In particular, subgroups of canine patients in urgent needs, e.g. dogs with drug-resistant epilepsy, might benefit from more intensive research in this area. Moreover, canine epilepsy shares remarkable similarities in etiology, disease manifestation, and disease progression with human epilepsy. Thus, canine epilepsy is discussed as a translational model for the human disease and epileptic dogs could provide a complementary species for the evaluation of antiepileptic and antiseizure drugs. This review reports key preclinical and clinical findings from experimental research and human medicine supporting the role of neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of epilepsy. Moreover, the article provides an overview of the current state of knowledge regarding neuroinflammatory processes in canine epilepsy emphasizing the urgent need for further research in this specific field. It also highlights possible functional impact, translational potential and future perspectives of targeting specific inflammatory pathways as disease-modifying and multi-target treatment options for canine epilepsy.},

	abstract = {A 10-week-old, male German shepherd dog was presented with a primary complaint of episodic ptyalism, dysphagia, vomiting, and mandibular salivary gland enlargement. An esophagram with fluoroscopy showed normal pharyngeal and esophageal function; however, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and cervical ultrasonography revealed a focal circumferential thickening of the midcervical esophageal muscular wall, consistent with esophageal spasm. The puppy responded dramatically and completely to phenobarbital treatment. An unusual syndrome of phenobarbital-responsive hypersialosis was consistent with this dog's clinical presentation and the finding of apparent esophageal spasm. The pathogenesis of this syndrome is unclear, but it may represent a form of limbic epilepsy or peripheral autonomic dysfunction.},
