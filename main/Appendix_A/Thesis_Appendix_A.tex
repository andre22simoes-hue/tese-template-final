\chapter{Vector calculus}
\label{chapter:appendixVectors}

In case an appendix if deemed necessary, the document cannot exceed a total of 100 pages...

Some definitions and vector identities are listed in the section below.

\begin{equation}
	\nabla \times \left( \nabla \phi \right) = 0
	\label{eq:cross_nnp}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	\nabla \cdot \left( \nabla \times {\bf u} \right) = 0
	\label{eq:dotCross_nnu}

The research should be supported with a comprehensive list of references.
These should appear whenever necessary, in the limit, from the first to the last chapter.

A reference can be cited in any of the following ways:
%
\begin{itemize}
  \item Citation mode \#1 - \quad \cite{jameson:adjointns}
  \item Citation mode \#2 - \quad \citet{jameson:adjointns}
  \item Citation mode \#3 - \quad \citep{jameson:adjointns}
  \item Citation mode \#4 - \quad \citet*{jameson:adjointns}
  \item Citation mode \#5 - \quad \citep*{jameson:adjointns}
  \item Citation mode \#6 - \quad \citealt{jameson:adjointns}
  \item Citation mode \#7 - \quad \citealp{jameson:adjointns}
  \item Citation mode \#8 - \quad \citeauthor{jameson:adjointns}
  \item Citation mode \#9 - \quad \citeyear{jameson:adjointns}
  \item Citation mode \#10 - \quad \citeyearpar{jameson:adjointns}
\end{itemize}
%
Several citations can be made simultaneously as \citep{nocedal:opt,marta:ijcfd}. \\

This is often the default bibliography style adopted (numbers following the citation order), according to the options:\\
{\tt \textbackslash usepackage\{natbib\}} in file {\tt Thesis\_Preamble.tex},\\
{\tt \textbackslash bibliographystyle\{abbrvnat\}} in file {\tt Thesis.tex}.\\
%
Notice however that this style can be changed from numerical citation order to authors' last name with the options: \\
{\tt \textbackslash usepackage[numbers]\{natbib\}} in file {\tt Thesis\_Preamble.tex},\\
{\tt \textbackslash bibliographystyle\{abbrvunsrtnat\}} in file {\tt Thesis.tex}.
